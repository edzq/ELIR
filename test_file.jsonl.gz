However, these analysis methods become increasingly expensive in terms of computation time if the attacker has no prior knowledge about when leakage occurs. In many realistic scenarios, the attacker only has a global trigger signal, resulting in long leakage traces. Long traces result in very long analysis time, since the computational complexity of analysis grows in polynomial of the trace length with degree d+1 of the order of the attack. In this paper, we propose a novel, intuitive, yet efficient algorithm that trades the abundance in the number of leakage traces and the signal-to-noise ratio into computational efficiency during processing. The proposed algorithm reaches an exponential improvement of O(log(N)) for the processing time, where N is the number of samples in the trace.

The exciting signals are random, stationary and white, with a bounded (unknown) probability density function, and system outputs are corrupted by a zero-mean stationary random noise \u2013 white or coloured. The a priori information is poor. In particular, no parametric form of the non-linear characteristics is known in advance. To recover non-linearities, a class of non-parametric identification algorithms is proposed and investigated. The algorithms use only input\u2013output measurements and are based on multiscale orthogonal approximations associated with scaling functions of compact support. We establish the pointwise weak consistency of such routines along with asymptotic rates of convergence. In particular, local ability of the algorithms to discover non-linear characteristics in dependence on local smoothness of the identified non-linearity, input density and the scaling function is examined. It is shown that under mild requirements the routines attain optimal rate of convergence. The form and convergence of the algorithms are insensitive to correlation of the noise.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0165-1684(00)00247-4", "venue": "Signal Process.", "journal": "Signal Process.", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2033757134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["120450474", "120368951", "5108870", "61452774", "124078690", "123143070", "7113071", "119529428", "122693259", "121892953", "120830481", "106461482", "36077838", "125324922", "117961144", "115136589", "24131627", "14615701", "2367745", "122992694", "19796001", "2356353", "122523543", "120067924", "119002689", "122627226", "62733681", "11927743", "14444668", "65112390", "16471256", "121260138", "5422489", "119054264", "198189892", "124218927", "121990450", "35651025", "40767655"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18988392"}

In order to address this question, we make two assumptions. First, the key architectural feature of dendrites responsible for many of their information processing abilities is the existence of independent sub-units performing local non-linear processing. Second, any general functional principles operate at a level of abstraction in which neurons are modelled by Boolean functions. To accommodate these assumptions, we therefore define a Boolean model neuron-the multi-cube unit (MCU)-which instantiates the notion of the discrete functional sub-unit. We then use this model unit to explore two aspects of neural functionality: generalisation (in this paper) and processing complexity (in its companion). Generalisation is dealt with from a geometric viewpoint and is quantified using a new metric-the set of order parameters. These parameters are computed for threshold logic units (TLUs), a class of random Boolean functions, and MCUs. Our interpretation of the order parameters is consistent with our knowledge of generalisation in TLUs and with the lack of generalisation in randomly chosen functions. Crucially, the order parameters for MCUs imply that these functions possess a range of generalisation behaviour. We argue that this supports the general thesis that dendrites facilitate input pattern generalisation despite any local non-linear processing within functionally isolated sub-units.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11681759", "doi": "10.1016/S0893-6080(01)00062-4", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "mag_id": "1537138411,2941352445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14922658", "10858135", "117468672"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2874845"}

Whereas the conventional methods separate simultaneously EEG signals of interest along with noise, the result of this example shows the proposed methods recover from the outset solely those EEG signals of interest.

In comparison with partitioning methods, the approach has the following advantages: the user can specify a minimum density for the outcoming modules and has the guarantee that all modules that satisfy this criterion are discovered. Moreover, it provides a natural way to detect overlapping modules. Many proteins are not steadily present in the cell, but are specifically expressed in dependence of cell type, environmental conditions, and developmental state.

The curved panels exhibit high risk of loss of stability especially with modern requirements for increasingly lighter designs. Correct identification of the load-carrying capabilities and thorough understanding of the stability behavior under transient excitations provide necessary information to safely design such structural components. In this work we use the arclength and branch-switching methods to correctly identify the buckling load and all equilibria. Compared to other methods, prior knowledge of the bifurcation modes is not required and the same mesh is used for tracing all secondary equilibrium paths. This method can identify secondary branches that other procedures failed to retrieve. Finally, the transient behavior of curved panels is also examined; in particular we seek to identify the dynamic snap-through boundary that separates small amplitude non-snap from large amplitude post-snap vibrations. Typically, analytical solutions for such highly nonlinear behavior are not available, and extensive parametric studies are usually required leading to very high computational cost. We examine the connections between different dynamic snap-through boundaries and seek to correlate them with features of the equilibrium manifold to identify computationally more efficient ways for their estimation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-29739-2_24", "venue": "Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series", "journal": "Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series", "mag_id": "2479243760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123627154"}

Experimental observations indicated that the communication between neurons is unreliable. However most modelling and computational studies considered deterministic synaptic interaction model. In this paper, we investigate the population rate coding in an all-to-all coupled recurrent neuronal network consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons connected with unreliable synapses. We use a stochastic on-off process to model the unreliable synaptic transmission. We find that synapses with suitable successful transmission probability can enhance the encoding performance in the case of weak noise; while in the case of strong noise, the synaptic interactions reduce the encoding performance. We also show that several important synaptic parameters, such as the excitatory synaptic strength, the relative strength of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, as well as the synaptic time constant, have significant effects on the performance of the population rate coding. Further simulations indicate that the encoding dynamics of our considered network cannot be simply determined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron in a time instant.

The proposed estimator is shown to be strongly consistent for any sensing noise distribution in the i.i.d. case both for a per-sensor power constraint, and a total power constraint. When the distributions of the sensing noise are not identical, a bound on the variances is shown to establish strong consistency. The estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal with a variance (AsV) that depends on the characteristic function of the sensing noise. Optimization of the AsV is considered with respect to a transmission phase parameter for a variety of noise distributions exhibiting differing levels of impulsive behavior. The robustness of the estimator to impulsive sensing noise distributions such as those with positive excess kurtosis, or those that do not have finite moments is shown. The proposed estimator is favorably compared with the amplify and forward scheme under an impulsive noise scenario. The effect of fading is shown to not affect the consistency of the estimator, but to scale the asymptotic variance by a constant fading penalty depending on the fading statistics.

Firstly, the mathematical model of relative movement considering the second-order dynamic delay of engine is set up according to the planar relative motion of missile and target. Secondly, based on the principle of nullifying the line of sight angular velocity and the theory of finite time convergence, the finite time convergence condition and properties of the sliding-mode guidance law under thrust constraint is given. Furthermore the convergence condition is expanded to consider the second-order dynamics of divert thruster.

In contrast to traditional algorithms based on line-of-sight, this algorithm runs completely within the programmable 3D visualization pipeline to render 3D terrains with viewshed analysis. The most important difference is its integration of the viewshed calculation with the rendering module. Invisible areas are rendered as shadows in the 3D scene. The algorithm process is paralleled by rasterizer units in the graphics card and by vertex and pixel shaders executed on the GPU. We have implemented this method in our 3D Digital Earth system with the DirectX 9.0c API and tested on some consumer-level PC plat...", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/17538947.2011.555565", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Digital Earth", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2049956286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1610858", "62200163", "205525246", "538139", "60746939", "10680920", "61072112", "11005264", "2629883", "18320563", "15227435"], "inbound_citations": ["52828162", "5944642", "52157121", "25112189", "189927451", "133769466", "11387791"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41511448"}

The resource allows the electronic publica- tion of essays, unpublished data and reviews on steroid receptors. These publications will not be reviewed or edited and should allow the rapid disse- mination of information to the scientific community. The resource can be reached at: http://biochem1.basic-sci.georgetown.edu/grr/grr.html. The glucocorticoid receptor is a member of the steroid/thyroid/ retinoic acid receptor superfamily. As occurs with other members of this family, activation by hormone results in modulation of transcription of target genes. This modulation is brought about by interaction of the receptor with a DNA response element that has the characteristics of an enhancer. The glucocorticoid receptor database focuses on the structure and function of the glucocorti- coid receptor but also contains some information on other steroid receptors. The database is composed of three main elements. The first contains World Wide Web (WWW) links to sequence, bibliographic and structural databases. The second contains information (and WWW links where possible) on sources of cDNA clones, probes, cell lines and mutants that may be of interest to those in the steroid receptor field. The third part of the database is currently being developed. It will be a forum for the rapid, unedited, unreviewed publication of data, reviews and essays on any subject relating to steroid receptors.

Compared with the original model, the new algorithm has the similar results with the increase of its model size asymptotically; compared with the most efficient CSC algorithm known, the new algorithm runs faster and has a wider range of suitable data sets. Meanwhile, a scalable semisupervised cluster ensemble algorithm is also proposed via the combination of our fast CSC algorithm and dimensionality reduction with random projection in the process of spectral ensemble clustering. We demonstrate by presenting theoretical analysis and empirical results that the new cluster ensemble algorithm has advantages in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

That is, KM aims at facilitating an environment where work critical information can be created, structured, shared, distributed and used. To be effective, KM must provide users with relevant knowledge, at the right time and in the right form, that enables users to better perform their tasks. Knowledge Management (KM) has been a predominant trend in business in the recent years. Though KM is primarily a management discipline (with a background in human resource management, strategy, and organizational behavior), the role of information technology as an enabling factor is widely recognized, and \u2013 after a first phase where merely general purpose technology like Internet/Intranets or email were found to be useful to facilitate KM \u2013 variety of proposals exist to support KM with specialized information systems [3]. Often, IT research for KM focused on the comprehensive use of an organization\u2019s knowledge, thus aiming at the completeness of distribution of relevant information. Technically, this is typically supported by centralized approaches: knowledge about people, processes or domain knowledge is represented and maintained in global repositories which serve as sources to meet a knowledge worker\u2019s (potentially complex) information needs. Such repositories may be structured by global ontologies (e.g., in form of knowledge portals) or they may be rather flat and processed by weak (i.e. not knowledge\u2013intensive) methods like statistics\u2013based information retrieval or collaborative filtering. However, as is often mentioned in the literature, knowledge tasks have a collaborative aspect, that is, an individual can best acquire and use knowledge by making use of existing relations among people (communities) or by reusing and personalizing information already collected and annotated by others. Furthermore, a KM system must be able to adapt to changes in the environment, to the different needs and preferences of users, and to integrate naturally with existing work methods, tools and processes. That is, KM systems must be reactive (able to respond to user requests or environment changes) and proactive (able to take initiatives to attend to user needs). These aspects also characterise intelligent software agents, what seems to indicate the applicability of agent technology in the KM area. Intelligent agents as a paradigm for developing software applications are currently the focus of intense interest on the part of many fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.

Such bounds are of interest both because of the high or prohibitive cost of computing the exact expected values, and because the exact values will depend on the extent to which management avails itself of the opportunities for rerouting of flows in response to link failures. Algorithms for computing these bounds are discussed. These algorithms are sufficiently efficient to be applied to large networks having numerous possible failure states. An application to water-network seismic risk analysis is described. I. INTRODUCTION Networks subjected to extreme events such as earthquakes or severe weather are apt to experience failures of individual links. This paper presents computable bounds on network performance for these cases, the bounds being calculated by solving minimum-cost flow routing problems. These bounds were developed to assess network performance for numerous possible situations, for nonlinear performance measures, and for large networks. Two measures of network performance are used here: (i) the expected flow to all demand nodes and (ii) the expected benefits due to flows, where benefits are a function of flows from supply nodes to demand nodes. In some cases, the bounds proposed here will equal the expected network performance. In particular, a bound is exact for cases in which a manager is unable or unwilling to reroute flows after link failures occur. Calculation of bounds on network performance is proposed because the exact determination of network performance, subject to probabilisitic failure, is excessively burdensome for large networks. For a network with n links subject to failure there are 2\" failure states to be enumerated. Even calculation of the probability that a desired flow pattern may be achieved involves substantial computation; Willie [8] presents one algorithm to calculate this probability, based upon enumeration of link sets whch either ensure (in the case of successful operation of all members) or prevent (in the case of failure of all members) successful operation of the network. Partial enumeration of such sets reduces computation time, but introduces a possible bias in the resulting probability estimate.

In a light-trail, the optical shutters at the start node and the end node are configured to be in OFF state and the optical shutters at the intermediate nodes are configured to be in ON state. Thus, an optical bus is formed, allowing traffic multiplexing without the state change of any optical shutter. This, however, limits the system throughput and also makes it impossible to implement a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol to assure quality of service (QoS) in a light-trail. With the recent development on ultrafast optical shutter, we propose an improved light-trail architecture, called opportunistic hyperchannel in this paper. In an opportunistic hyperchannel, an intermediate node can dynamically control its optical shutter which makes it possible to design a fully distributed QoS assuring MAC protocol. We then present a QoS assuring distributed dynamic scheduling protocol, namely, minimum source round robin (minSrcRR) protocol, for opportunistic hyperchannels. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed QoS assuring protocol and the worst-case delay bound are also derived in this paper.

Our method, while not necessarily perfect at imitation learning, is very amenable to further improvement via environment interaction, allowing it to scale to challenging long-horizon tasks. We simplify the long-horizon policy learning problem by using a novel data-relabeling algorithm for learning goal-conditioned hierarchical policies, where the low-level only acts for a fixed number of steps, regardless of the goal achieved. While we rely on demonstration data to bootstrap policy learning, we do not assume access to demonstrations of every specific tasks that is being solved, and instead leverage unstructured and unsegmented demonstrations of semantically meaningful behaviors that are not only less burdensome to provide, but also can greatly facilitate further improvement using reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we develop a direct adaptive control framework for linear uncertain non-negative and compartmental systems. The proposed framework is Lyapunov-based and guarantees partial asymptotic set-point regulation; that is, asymptotic set-point stability with respect to part of the closed-loop system states associated with the plant. In addition, the adaptive controller guarantees that the physical system states remain in the non-negative orthant of the state space. Finally, a numerical example involving the infusion of the anesthetic drug propofol for maintaining a desired constant level of depth of anesthesia for non-cardiac surgery is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Once the data is stored, the client supplies some keywords to the cloud server and requests the corresponding data. If the data is stored in plaintext form, data privacy will be violated. Thus the client encrypts the data along with the realted keywords, and then stores the ciphertext in the cloud server. Encryption of data maintains the confidentiality, but this makes keyword search difficult. To solve this issue, designated server based public key encryption with keyword search (dPEKS) scheme is used. In dPEKS scheme, to get the encrypted data, the client computes a trapdoor related to a relevant keyword, and sends it to the cloud server, which then gives the ciphertext to the client provided that the trapdoor is verified. Hence, the client gets the data from the ciphertext. However, an adversary will not get any information on the data or the keywords. A certificateless dPEKS (CL-dPEKS) scheme is proposed in this paper. It provides indistinguishability to the ciphertext and trapdoor, and resilience to off-line keyword guessing attack.

We use a rich panel of data that has information on test scores, as well as broadband usage for all schools in Portugal, allowing us to control for school-specific effects. Additionally we use an instrument to account for possible unobserved time-varying effects. For 9th grade students, our estimates indicate that a higher use of broadband Internet is detrimental for students' test scores, despite this effect seeming to be wearing off with time. We find that the adverse effect tends to be reinforced for boys and weakened for girls, compared to the pooled estimates. We also find that schools with worse performance right before the introduction of broadband Internet in schools suffered the most. Our results suggest that introduction of broadband Internet in schools is not enough to improve students' performance.

However, it is a challenging problem due to the limited network resources and complicated operations of multimedia applications as well as dynamic changes of network condition. This paper begins with the challenges and requirements in the design of WMSN routing, followed by an exhaustive survey on routing from the perspective of application requirements and key techniques. In particular, the existing routing solutions are classified into five major categories based on their design and optimization objectives, that is, QoS provisioning, multimedia awareness, energy efficiency, congestion avoidance, bandwidth optimization.

First, for protection of macrocell users' uplink communications, CTRL controls the maximum TX power of femtocell users based on the fedback macrocell's load margin so as to keep, on average, the macrocell load below a certain threshold. Second, CTRL determines the target SINRs of femtocell users, conditioned on the maximum TX power, to reach a Nash equilibrium based on their utility functions, thus achieving efficient coordination of uplink usage among femtocells. Third, for protection of femtocell users' uplink communications, the instantaneous TX power of each femtocell user is controlled to achieve the target SINR against bursty interference from nearby macrocell or femtocell users.

One fundamental yet unexploited challenge is how to maintain the large indexing structures within a single server subject to its memory constraint, which is extremely hard to scale up to millions or even billions of images. In this paper, we propose to parallelize the near duplicate visual search architecture to index millions of images over multiple servers, including the distribution of both visual vocabulary and the corresponding indexing structure. We optimize the distribution of vocabulary indexing from a machine learning perspective, which provides a \u201cmemory light\u201d search paradigm that leverages the computational power across multiple servers to reduce the search latency. Especially, our solution addresses two essential issues: \u201cWhat to distribute\u201d and \u201cHow to distribute\u201d. \u201cWhat to distribute\u201d is addressed by a \u201clossy\u201d vocabulary Boosting, which discards both frequent and indiscriminating words prior to distribution. \u201cHow to distribute\u201d is addressed by learning an optimal distribution function, which maximizes the uniformity of assigning the words of a given query to multiple servers. We validate the distributed vocabulary indexing scheme in a real world location search system over 10 million landmark images. Comparing to the state-of-the-art alternatives of single-server search [5], [6], [16] and distributed search [23], our scheme has yielded a significant gain of about 200% speedup at comparable precision by distributing only 5% words.

Also most sentiment lexicons consider limited polarity values (usually 2 or 3), therefore may convey very little information for distinguishing between a sentence that is positive and one that is negative. This paper proposes to address these limitations by making use of term-based sentiment lexicons, by increasing the number of possible polarity values considered in lexicons, and by processing the sentences for local negation. Finally we propose a novel sentiment representation generated by merging the word features with the developed sentiment features in a single sequence.

The purpose of this study is to derive bounds for the condition number of these preconditioned conjugate gradient methods which depend only on a parameter in an isoperimetric inequality, two geometric parameters characterizing John and uniform domains, and the maximum number of edges of any subdomain. A related purpose is to explore to what extent well-known technical tools previously developed for quite regular subdomains can be extended to much more irregular subdomains. Some of these results are valid for any John domain, while an extension theorem, which is needed in this study, requires that the subdomains have complements which are uniform. The results, so far, are complete only for problems in two dimensions. Details are worked out for a FETI-DP algorithm and numerical results support the findings.

Procedures are as follows: (1) Let a neural network with a mixed structure learn the unknown dynamics of a nonlinear plant with arbitrary order, (2) after the learning is completed, the network is expanded into an equivalent feedforward multilayer network, (3) it is shown that the gradient of a criterion functional to be optimized can be easily obtained from this multilayer network, and then (4) the optimal control is generated by applying any of the existing non-linear programming algorithm based on this gradient information.

This article presents a distributed computing approach that uses a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation method to solve the stochastic network loading problem. The authors\u2019 work accelerates the Monte Carlo simulation method by using a distributed computing system. They adopt three distributed computing approaches for the workload partition of the Monte Carlo simulation method. The first approach allocates each processor in the distributed computing system to solve each trial of the simulation in parallel and in turns. The second approach assigns all the processors to solve the shortest-path problems in one trial of the Monte Carlo simulation concurrently. The third approach combines the first two, so different trials of the Monte Carlo simulation as well as the shortest path problems in one trial are solved simultaneously. The authors report on their comprehensive testing of these three approaches, first on the Sioux-Falls network and then on a randomly generated network example. Their results demonstrate that computational time for the probit-based SUE problem can be largely reduced by any of these three approaches. However, they stress that the first approach is the best one, which they demonstrate by using it to calculate the probit-based SUE problem on a large-scale network example.

The game, capitalizing on the wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability, can be played both indoors and outdoors, and thus gives players a new exciting gaming experience that profits by the blend of real and virtual game elements. The physical game acquires physical interactions among players, which can bring exciting and novel features to the game and more importantly, avoids some problems caused by traditional computer games such as health problems. The WSN is a promising technology for developing physical games. Although there is already some research and applications of WSN based physical games, the major advantages of the WSN (e.g. wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability) are not fully cultivated in these gaming applications. ePet, which takes good advantages of both the WSN and traditional computer games, simulates a pet both indoors and outdoors. The pet has two life modes: Peaceful Life Mode (PLM) and Aggressive Life Mode (ALM). In the PLM, ePet simulates the physiological activities of a real pet such as hunger and easily getting flu when it is cold in the real world. Moreover, the pet can date with other pets to increase its physiological values. In the ALM, the pet is a character of an RPG controlled by the player and the pet can have a fight with other pets, from which the pet gains experience for level up. This ALM is similar to the computer RPG games but relatively novel in WSN based games. All of the above features are enabled by the WSN technology. For the two life modes, a friend-making protocol and an RPG battle protocol are designed respectively. The architecture design and implementation of ePet are described in detailed. Unlike traditional WSN based games, ePet does not need a centralized base station to organize the network. To implement a self-adaptive wireless sensor network in which each node has a similar functionality, and solve the network conflict problems in the WSN communications, a multi-hop communication routing protocol is designed for ePet. Furthermore, a PC application was developed as the game interface, from which players can check out the ePet's properties and interact with ePet. It makes ePet more attractive than traditional WSN based games without losing WSN's advantages.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/15501320802555262", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2001116996", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44890658", "16814699", "8754247"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62653857"}

On the second model, we use a probabilistic measure to determine the ratio of computing servers to storage servers and thus complete the performance model. The data of execution traces obtained from the testbed is analyzed. Hurst parameter is estimated using the Abry\u2013Veitch estimator and distribution parameters are estimated for different probability distributions. Models based on the Pareto and Gamma probability distributions are developed and used with the data that was analyzed. There seems to be a good agreement between our models, the experimental execution traces, and simulations of HP computing environments. Specifically, the Pareto Fractal Flow model is compared with other models based on the Gamma and Gaussian distributions, such as the FGN and M-G-\u221e, and it seems to make better predictions under our experimental conditions.

However, with incremental \u2018patches\u2019 on the Internet, the current network architecture faces many problems which are too difficult to solve. In the light of recent interest in re-designing the Internet, the separation of core network and customer edge network, and the separation of identifier and locator receive wide consensus among scientists. We follow this direction and propose a new hierarchical network with diversified customer edge access (HNDCE) in this paper. We use switching addresses, routing addresses and identifiers to implement a true core/edge and locator/identifier split. In the core network, hierarchical switching addresses combined with tree topology makes routing replaced by switching. The Viliant load-balancing (VLB) structure is used here to compensate the topology's reliability and scalability. In the customer edge network, the split of locator and identifier makes it possible to deploy various routing schemes and new services. Hierarchical mapping system is also designed to support this new architecture.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1005-8885(10)60091-X", "venue": null, "journal": "The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications", "mag_id": "2014595912", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62655209"}

The travel time for the route in the near future and its accuracy are estimated by using a state equation of the forecasting model. The validity of the method is verified using real data.

While grayscale image segmentation has become quite a mature field, much less work has been done with regard to color image segmentation. Until recently, this was predominantly due to the lack of available computing power and color display hardware that is required to manipulate true color images (24-bit). TOday, it is not uncommon to find a standard desktop computer system with a true-color 24-bit display, at least 8 million bytes of memory, and 2 gigabytes of hard disk storage. Segmentation of color images is not as simple as segmenting each of the three RGB color components separately. The difficulty of using the RGB color space is that it doesn't closely model the psychological understanding of color. A better color model, which closely follows that of human visual perception is the hue, saturation, intensity model. This color model separates the color components in terms of chromatic and achromatic information. Strickland et al. was able to show the importance of color in the extraction of edge features form an image. His method enhances the edges that are detectable in the luminance image with information from the saturation image. Segmentation of both the saturation and intensity components is easily accomplished with any gray scale segmentation algorithm, since these spaces are linear. The modulus 2(pi) nature of the hue color component makes its segmentation difficult. For example, a hue of 0 and 2(pi) yields the same color tint. Instead of applying separate image segmentation to each of the hue, saturation, and intensity components, a better method is to segment the chromatic component separately from the intensity component because of the importance that the chromatic information plays in the segmentation of color images. This paper presents a method of using the gray scale K-means algorithm to segment 24-bit color images. Additionally, this paper will show the importance the hue component plays in the segmentation of color images.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.271117", "venue": "Electronic Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2589236253,2029542629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["120865286", "13095870", "31919071", "15326934", "58813594", "32002313", "35812367", "47568090", "120804682", "62655791", "115479255"], "inbound_citations": ["6517407", "7682397", "122666851", "15924404", "12992338", "20216149", "8877961", "10071936", "14294651", "9758165", "5120129", "40985072", "122096969", "42431268", "18763723", "32566173", "44627354", "125298648", "208213285", "54155710", "38084026", "1342336", "6071001", "3634605", "17155902", "5721208", "28933135", "2314125", "2279060", "2076108", "29029432", "53702490", "14589926", "2928102", "53365138", "212703193", "45928674", "13085957", "31382596", "19498604", "51962987", "13965368"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62657682"}

It turns out, that our non-hydrodynamical ansatz for the flows results in a very advantageous behavior of the model. Next the fitting conditions at junctions of a traffic network are discussed. In the following sections we carry out a continuous approximation of our discrete model in order to derive stationary solutions and to consider the stability of the homogeneous one. It turns out, that for certain conditions unstable traffic flow occurs. In a subsequent section, we compare the stability of the discrete model and the corresponding continuous approximation. This confirms in retrospection the close similarities of both model versions. Finally we compare the results of our model with the results of another macroscopic model, that was recently suggested by Kerner and Konhauser [Phys. Rev.

AI-Yaseer, a mechanism analysis software package that was developed at King Abdulaziz University (KAU) specifically for undergraduate teaching, is briefly reviewed. The concept of a virtual link as an aid in mechanism analysis is reiterated. Kinematic relationships are derived for the first inversion of the slidercrank mechanism, such that it features a flexible crank. The utility of the concept of a virtual flexible link in enhancing the domain of applicability of AI-Yaseer to a variety of realistic problems in the kinematic as well as the dynamic analysis of mechanisms is demonstrated.

The result on the number of subalgebras in a Boolean algebra solves a question of Monk from [6]. The paper is intended to be accessible as far as possible to a general audience, in particular we have confined the more technical material to a \"black box\" at the end. The proof involves a variation on Foreman and Woodin's model in which GCH fails everywhere. ?1. Definitions and facts. In this section we give some basic definitions, and prove a couple of useful facts about algebras and free subsets. We refer the reader to [3] for the definitions of set-theoretic terms. Throughout this paper we are working in ZFC set theory. DEFINITION 1.1. Let M be a set. F is a finitary function on M if and only if F: M' M for some finite n.

In this case we say 4' is an algebra on M. DEFINITION 1.3. Let ' = (M, Y) be an algebra and let N C M. Then N is a subalgebra of 4' if and only if N is closed under all the functions in i9. In this case there is a natural algebra structure on N given by X = (N, 9 [ X). DEFINITION 1.4. Let 4' (M, Y) be an algebra. Then Sub(X) {= N : N is a subalgebra of X }. DEFINITION 1.5.

A corresponding low-level Schema describes the actual layout of data and is used by the compiler for code generation. The compiler needs a systematic way for translating the high-level code to a low-level code. Then, it needs to transform the generated low-level code to achieve high locality and efficient execution.

The existing methods, however, failed to assure the developed applications that contain ambiguities between the features generated in FMs by analyzers' intuitions, and hindered the reuse of such applications. Moreover, the accuracy measurements of models based on mathematics-based theoretical verification methods are difficult to apply in practice. Therefore, a refinement technique is demanded to enhance the FM accuracy. This paper aims to identify abnormal feature duplications and collisions based on the feature attributes to address the potential ambiguities between the features in an FM generated for a target domain, and to construct more precise FMs by presenting a technique for eliminating such abnormalities. For this purpose, the profiles of the formalized attributes were first defined based on MDR. Based on the semantics and relationships between the attributes, the duplications and collisions were identified using an analysis matrix, and were generalized to formulate rules by level. Such rules were evaluated to remove the duplications and collisions. In addition, using a supporting analyzer, the features in the initial FM were registered on a repository and were analyzed for feature duplications and collisions based on the saved attribute data. The refinements of the ambiguities between such features are likely to enable the construction of more precise application FMs and the generation of common features with higher reusability. Further, the environments using support tools are expected to provide convenience in the similarity analysis and reuse of features.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S021819401450020X", "venue": "International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering", "journal": "International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering", "mag_id": "2053770519", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5401166"}

SURF(Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm is based on feature points pair to achieve matching, and can get good results in the seabed relief image matching. However, in practical applications, the traditional SURF algorithm is easy to get false matching, especially when the area\u2019s features are similar or not obvious, the problem is more seriously. In order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, this paper proposes an improved matching algorithm, which combines the SURF, and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithms. The new algorithm integrates the two algorithms advantages, firstly, the SURF algorithm is applied to detect and extract the feature points then to pre-match. Secondly, RANSAC algorithm is utilized to eliminate mismatching points, and then the accurate matching is accomplished with the correct matching points. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm overcomes the mismatching problem effectively and have better precision and faster speed than the traditional SURF algorithm.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1051/itmconf/20171205017", "venue": "ITM Web of Conferences", "journal": "ITM Web of Conferences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2750902452", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["132353912", "123926291", "4920201", "124971829", "972888", "124390009", "123273845", "12735062", "61112084"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55921835"}

Initially, more work was required to archive historical maps than written documents, as they needed to be imaged in sections and then recombined. However, recent improvements in imaging technology and information devices have made it comparatively easy to create digital archives. In recent years, it has even become possible to view and download digital images of historical maps from sites run by the organizations possessing these maps, as well as from cross-searchable portal sites such as Old Maps Online (https://www.oldmapsonline.org) and Map Warper (https://mapwarper.net).These portal sites provide terrestrial georeferencing functionality, in which historical maps are superimposed on a projected coordinate system. This allows the sharing of geometrically corrected historical maps and images, as well as linking table information for control points created during the georeferencing process. As progress is made creating and publishing digital archives of these historical maps, it will become increasingly important to increase both the depth and number of methodologies used to analyze historical maps using GIS.In this study, I make use of image data from historical maps that have been geometrically corrected as well as control points created during the georeferencing process to conduct a GIS analysis of historicalmaps of several cities.

A main example of a platform implementing this view is JaCaMo, which allows the programming of a MAS in terms of an organisation of cognitive agents sharing a common artifact-based environment. However, MAS models and platforms in general do not provide a satisfactory approach for MAS developers to uniformly deal with distribution at multiple dimensions -- agent, environment, and organisation. Typically, environments are either centralised in a single node, or composed by parts that run on different nodes but with a poor support at the programming and execution levels to deal with that. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a model for engineering world-wide distributed environments and organisations for MAS. The approach integrates the A&A (Agents and Artifacts) conceptual model with a web/resource-oriented view of distributed systems as proposed by the REST architectural style. To evaluate the approach, an extension of the JaCaMo open-source platform has been developed implementing the proposed model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAMAS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921386702", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12833808", "15520950", "26294851", "60450021", "59910544", "196614031", "88466171", "32120030", "19536483", "43551822", "46411539", "6257455", "296548", "16537272", "2202519", "42407513", "206463383", "3185097", "43935408", "207243362", "29991509", "1376025", "18063457", "9922541", "1336688", "64238441", "15863786", "7415468", "34839899"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88483170"}

The control system is a multiagent system consists of several traffic control agents. The agents work cooperatively using the proposed distributed reinforcement learning approach to maximize the freeway traffic mobility and safety benefits. The traffic mobility objective is to maintain freeway traffic density slightly under the critical point to produce the maximum traffic volume, while the traffic safety objective is to reduce the speed difference between adjacent segments. The merits of distributed reinforcement learning are its model-free nature, and it can improve its performance continually as time goes on. The control system is developed on an open source traffic simulation software. Results revealed that compared with no control cases, the proposed system can noticeably decrease the total travel time and increase the bottleneck outflow. Moreover, the speed difference between freeway segments indicating the potential rear-end collision risk is significantly reduced.

To optimize the profit of service provider, the profit analysis and optimization framework tailored toward the new business model and mmWave HSR networks is developed. This framework consists of three main components including admission control, transmission control, and resource purchasing control.

In particular, UML is being broadly applied to data modeling in many application domains, and generating linked data repositories from the UML class model is becoming a challenging task in the context of semantic web. This paper proposes an approach, in which we will build a construction tool by joining the characteristics of RDF (Resource Description Framework) and UML. Firstly we will formally define design artifacts and linked data repositories. After that we will propose a construction tool in which we will extract UML artifacts, these UML class model further transforms into the corresponding RDFs. The generated RDF linked data then will be verified by using W3C RDF, this is a validating service used to generate and verify the RDF triples and graphs. Finally, the proposed construction tool will be implemented with few experiments and research is validated using W3C RDF validating service.

As a result of people taking more and more pictures in their lives, image assessment technology, which can automatically help people choose high quality pictures quickly, has become particularly important. Most algorithms use peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) to assess image quality. However, images with high scores on PSNR are not as beautiful as individuals think. Image aesthetic assessment technology can come closer to human aesthetic standards. We report on a method named saliency symbiosis network for image aesthetic assessment. This is significant because we improved the conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN) method, which gets very close to the human visual mechanism after adding saliency features in CNN. Owing to considering limitations of CNN input size, we also proposed a pooling strategy to improve the ability of the model to accept arbitrary input sizes. Afterward, we propose an effective mean Huber loss function, which becomes less sensitive to outliers and can quickly train the model to being optimal.

The use of wearable devices and video-based approaches have attracted considerable interest in ubiquitous computing. Nevertheless, these methods have limitations such as issues with privacy invasion, ethics, comfort and obtrusiveness. Environmental sensors are an increasingly promising consideration in the ubiquitous computing domain for long-term monitoring, as these devices are non-invasive to inhabitants, yet certain challenges remain with activity recognition in sensorised environments, for example, addressing the challenge of intraclass variation between activities and reasoning from low-level uncertain information. In an effort to address these challenges, this paper proposes and evaluates the performance of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network approach for activity recognition with environmental sensors. The model is trained using the Localized Generalization Error and focuses on the generalization ability by considering both the training error and stochastic sensitivity measure. This measures the network output fluctuation with respect to the minor perturbation of input, to address the tolerance of the low-level uncertain sensor data. This approach is compared with three benchmark Neural Network approaches, including a popular deep learning approach using an Autoencoder, and it is evaluated with a simulated dataset as well as a number of publicly available datasets. The proposed method has shown advantages over the other models for all four evaluated datasets.

The STRaND-1 mission described in this paper is used to demonstrate the hurdles which must be overcome in order to create cost-effective CubeSat platforms that are ready for operational missions with satisfactory design lifetime, reliability and availability objectives. STRaND-1 is the UK\u2019s first CubeSat, and will be launched on the 25th of February 2013 on a PSLV into a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit. As with many CubeSats, the goals of the successful 3U mission were rapid training and technology demonstration. The novelty (other than the technical novelty of testing the robustness of mobile phone electronics in the LEO environment) was the volunteer nature of the team, and that the organisations involved had previous operational small satellite mission experience. This paper takes a holistic view of the mission, critically reviewing the mission lifecycle from the initial concept design through to integration and testing, LEOP and initial mission results in respect of these hurdles to operational applications. The UK's small satellite technology demonstration mission - TDS-1 - is presented for contrast. Now ready for flight in Q3 2013, TDS-1 is an example of how a collaborative small sat technology demonstration mission can be accomplished at low cost and inside a rapid schedule. TDS-1 incorporates a suite of eight separate sensor payloads plus a novel set of advanced avionics. The design, concept of operations and management of TDS-1 enabled the platform enough flexibility to accommodate the payloads to change in both number and in bus resources required throughout the programme lifecycle, while avoiding the pitfalls of over-designing the system. The review is conducted with an eye to how a CubeSat mission differs from the commercial, small satellite approach to spacecraft engineering. In particular, lessons learnt on CubeSat general system design philosophy, data bus topologies, and management philosophies are discussed and compared against the more traditional small sat approach, something on which the Surrey community can speak with authority.

Finger-mounted QME represents the first demonstration of a wearable elastography probe. The approach realizes optical coherence tomography-based elastography by focusing the optical beam into the sample via a single-mode fiber that is fused to a length of graded-index fiber. The fiber is rigidly affixed to a 3D-printed thimble that is mounted on the finger. Analogous to manual palpation, the probe compresses the tissue through the force exerted by the finger. The resulting deformation is measured using optical coherence tomography. Elasticity is estimated as the ratio of local stress at the sample surface, measured using a compliant layer, to the local strain in the sample. We describe the probe fabrication method and the signal processing developed to achieve accurate elasticity measurements in the presence of motion artifact. We demonstrate the probe\u2019s performance in motion-mode scans performed on homogeneous, bi-layer and inclusion phantoms and its ability to measure a thermally-induced increase in elasticity in ex vivo muscle tissue.

This is the case of real estate crowdfunding, a type of equity crowdfunding that aims to make housing investment available to retail investors, although several hazards have been detected that make these investments less secure. This paper addresses these hazards, analyses the information provided by five Spanish crowdfunding platforms to retail investors and determines whether or not real estate crowdfunding platforms in Spain, as a sharing economy mechanism, are making a contribution to the development of the housing market.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.clsr.2019.02.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Law & Security Review", "mag_id": "2921525170", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88487634"}

The modeling starts from a transfer function of the exact two-port network model used to represent the coupling between two antennas in free space. The Z parameter network of the system is used to model the power attenuation as function of the distance between the antennas. Subsequently, a new mathematical model is proposed and compared with the Z parameter network model and shown to have small mean squared error. Such model has the advantage of replacing the Friis formula without the restriction to avoid measuring signals in the near field of the antenna. Furthermore, some practical experiments are carried out in an open field environment and the results are compared. The validity of the new model is demonstrated which can be used for any distance between the antennas and, therefore, it can also be employed to model dense wireless networks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10776-019-00424-z", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Wireless Information Networks", "mag_id": "2921390724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88489276"}

The wide range of applications as well as the necessity of improving the performance of the existing algorithms lead to the invention of a great variety of subdivision schemes. In many cases, such as preserving the data shape, using normal meshes for better compression rates, removing heavily-tailed noise, working with manifold-valued data, linear multi-scale transforms give unsatisfactory results or cannot be applied at all, and nonlinear alternatives are necessary. There are still very few results about Lipschitz stability and Holder regularity of nonlinear subdivision schemes and the associated multi-scale transforms, which is a very active research field with many open problems, that is driven by both theory and applications. In this thesis we develop a general stability analysis of both univariate schemes and their associated multi-scale transforms in the nonlinear functional setting. We show that, unlike the linear setting, convergence and stability analysis are no longer equivalent, and we derive numerical criteria for the verification of each of them. We extend the univariate convergence and stability results to the multivariate regular setting via local approximation techniques. We establish a general theory for normal multi-scale transforms for curves, based on approximating prediction operators. We propose a globally-convergent normal multi-scale transform, and build an adaptive algorithm based on it that defines a well-posed transform with smooth limits and high detail decay rates. We investigate several extensions of the classical setup for normal multi-scale transforms, namely we use another subdivision operator to generate the normal directions, the combined action of two different subdivision operators for the prediction step, and nonlinear geometry-based predictors, respectively, and show that the properties of the normal multi-scale transforms improve when such extensions are considered.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2921024390", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["531620", "118435189"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88489368"}

The authors review various approaches to the study of creativity. One modern trend of studying creativity is by considering this ability as the special mental phenomenon, a psychological phenomenon of complex structure that includes various components, one of which is the ability to create new forms of art. In the context of this work, it is important to consider creativity and its components that are amenable to change and development. The concept of \u201cform-creativity\u201d is revealed as a structural component of creativity and creative process, i.e. the process of changing or transforming the subject of creative activity and obtaining an innovative form as a result. The authors present a model for a new research approach to form-creativity as a parameter of creativity in the design activity of primary school children. The model predetermines the selection of methods, both classical and modified, to be used in order to detect the intellectual parameters of form-creativity, i.e. \u201cSketches\u201d (by Elena E. Tunik), \u201cGraphic anagrams\u201d (by Tatiana A. Barysheva), and aesthetic ones, i.e. \u201cThe Geometry Song\u201d (by Elena M. Torshilova and Tatiana V. Morozova). The authors devote special attention to the analysis and interpretation of empirical research results and formulate three levels of form-creativity development in primary school children: \u201cApprentice\u201d, \u201cJourneyman\u201d, and \u201cMaster\u201d. The study also revealed some connections between intellectual parameters (a child\u2019s ability to transform) and aesthetic ones (a pupil\u2019s sense of form) with age peculiarities of primary school students. The authors propose a program for the development of form-creativity by means of design activities, grounding the urgency of the program, defining the tasks, and highlighting the principles and peculiarities of its practical organisation. Considering the peculiarities and specificity of the artistic design method as a factor of child development reform, the authors define directions and areas of similar work in creative workshops.

Development of uncertainty reasoning models offers a chance to research these complex correlations. The primary aim of this research was to construct a disaster chain hazard assessment model that combines a Bayesian Network model and the ArcGIS program software for Changbai Mountain, China, an active volcano with a spate of reported earthquakes, collapses, and landslide events. Furthermore, the probability obtained by the Bayesian Networks was used to determine the disaster chain probability and hazard intensity of the earthquake events, while ArcGIS was used to produce the disaster chain hazard map. The performance of the Bayesian Network model was measured by error rate and scoring rules. The confirmation of the outcomes of the disaster chain hazard assessment model shows that the model demonstrated good predictive performance on the basis of the area under the curve, which was 0.7929. From visual inspection of the produced earthquake disaster chain hazard map, highly hazardous zones are located within a 15 km radius from the Tianchi center, while the northern and the western parts of the studied area are characterized mainly by \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d hazard values.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ijgi8050210", "venue": "ISPRS Int.

This means that in addition to test reliability, all sentences or paragraphs should be reliable and equally difficult to read. The sentences and paragraphs of five (un-) standardised Dutch reading tests were investigated in this regard. ::: ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: ::: Tests were performed with 71 normally sighted persons (mean age 55 [18\u201386] years). All sentences and paragraphs had equal print size. The relative difficulty of sentences and paragraphs from the five Dutch reading tests was tested with linear mixed models (reading speed) and generalised linear models (mistakes). ::: ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: Reading speed in standard words per min ranged from 179 (Radner) to 142 (De Nederlanders). Reading mistakes per 100 characters ranged from 0.25 (Radner) to 0.40 (Colenbrander). On the Colenbrander charts 7/24 sentences were read significantly faster vs 5/24 read slower (sentence reliability 0.56\u20130.87); International Reading Speed Texts 3/10 vs 3/10 [0.94\u20130.97]; Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology 14/55 vs 15/55 [0.64\u20130.92]; De Nederlanders 2/6 vs 3/6 [0.83\u20130.94]; Radner 4/24 vs 3/24 [0.73\u20130.87]. Agreement between tests differed from 1 to 36 standard words per minute and 0.01 to 0.14 mistakes per 100 characters. ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: ::: The Radner, with the highest number of equally difficult sentences, is appropriate to measure reading acuity as well as reading speed in a heterogeneous population; the International Reading Speed Texts, with the highest paragraph reliability, provides long paragraphs to measure reading speed. The Colenbrander and Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology are suitable for daily practice; however, for research or inspection purposes, reliable sentences must be chosen.

One of those issues should be a privacy of people. Also, when the UAVs fly to perform specific objectives, minimizing movements of UAVs is a big issue to provide a minimum mission completion time and a maximum network lifetime. One intuitive solution is that UAVs may pass through private area of citizens whereas people do not want any penetration into own area without a permission. Then, we may take into account a compromise between those situations by giving a differential permission for each UAV to access citizens' areas depending on specific benefits by use of UAVs or emergent situation for public safety. In this paper, we introduce a framework for privacy-preserving movements of UAVs with differential UAVs' permissions given by citizens.

However, this method has several shortcomings, such as long preparation time (30 min), complexity in operation, and contamination of red blood cells (RBCs). In this paper, a new PRP preparation approach was proposed and tested. Ultrasound waves (4.5 MHz) generated from piezoelectric ceramics can establish standing waves inside a syringe filled with the whole blood. Subsequently, RBCs would accumulate at the locations of pressure nodes in response to acoustic radiation force, and the formed clusters would have a high speed of sedimentation. It is found that the PRP prepared by the proposed device can achieve higher platelet concentration and less RBCs contamination than a commercial centrifugal device, but similar growth factor (i.e., PDGF-\u03b2\u03b2).

It is shown in this paper that under very loose conditions, the max-delay-utility scheduling has the maximum stability region. In environments with insufficient scattering or strong line-of-sight components, delay transmit diversity can increase the fluctuation in the frequency domain to improve the performance. The simulation results show that the max-delay-utility scheduling with a frugality constraint is highly advantageous to data transmission with a low latency requirement over shared multiple channels, and that joint scheduling and power allocation can substantially boost the performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070394", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2132221438", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1673156", "61897036", "7272374", "7620348", "1780592", "8905298", "12598394", "16908979", "207780755", "5665584", "8115201", "14207812", "14719466", "14886395", "57509", "37483773", "15223025", "14964341", "58179897", "14744368", "2743252", "61972532", "11188434", "50742905"], "inbound_citations": ["33068278", "31256010", "20941192", "206485964", "22228003", "9770404", "14196126", "3444448", "16570303", "17005934", "2114004", "24383016", "17279652", "206689889", "1972398", "16616368", "7085013", "5754135", "14792886", "40845502", "16534811", "710679", "20165070", "12634268", "22451450", "22893134", "3074170", "32243437", "24115372", "17066948", "4780440", "6176883", "11241303", "10428499", "8844842", "9782493", "16441062", "2560703", "11954982", "1017655", "9534594", "54436671", "15067633", "121242", "11916577", "2444706", "14641953", "24349577", "5582578", "34069657", "25264498"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23519856"}

Some of these are Serendipitous, while others are Orchestrated, the result of deliberate efforts by researchers to record speakers with different addressees or in different situations. The richest examples, involving Orchestrated Serendipitous Situational and Metaphorical shifting, come from recent work by Devyani Sharma and Ben Rampton, which is briefly summarized.

As a result, attention guidance strategies, which have long been a feature of static educational visualizations, have been the subject of increasing interest from researchers as a means of helping learners to extract task-relevant information from a dynamic visualization. This chapter discusses three different approaches to attention guidance that have been explored in research on learning from dynamic visualizations: (1) cueing, (2) eye movement modeling examples, and (3) gesturing. For each of these types of attention guidance, the main findings from empirical research regarding its effects on perceptual and cognitive processing of a dynamic visualization are discussed. These findings suggest that attention guidance can engender more appropriate forms of attention direction.

Currently a disabled officer is medically retired following a severe duty related injury, depriving the individual of a career and the force of an experienced officer in his/her prime. This result in billions of dollars of wasted talents and resources. As an ongoing effort at the Florida International University (FIU) Discovery Lab, researchers are designing, developing and testing a new telepresence robot designated as \u201cTeleBot\u201d to assess how it can be used to help disabled officers return to duty. More specifically, the work has been focused on the design and implementation of a smart telepresence robot with enhanced functionalities. This paper presents a detailed development and analysis of TeleBot and provides a field evaluation (demonstration/validation) of the current capabilities. The principal contribution of this paper comprises of robust communication architecture for efficient human interaction with the robot that almost resembles a law enforcement officer and capable of receiving commands that are issued by an actual disabled officer from a remote location. Two high definition cameras in the head assembly of TeleBot wirelessly transmit live video stream of the TeleBot\u2019s visual field to the remote operator wearing a virtual reality based stereoscopic display. Additionally, a voice recognition system enables the TeleBot to greet people and accept voice based commands from the operator. The user-friendly software embedded on the system provides a seamless communication between the officer at a remote location and diverse population through TeleBot. The striking factor of this design is affordability in terms of cost.

This paper proposes a method to estimate the AIF using the dynamic data from multiple reference tissues, assuming that their AIFs have the same shape, with a possible difference in bolus arrival time. By minimizing a cost function, one can simultaneously estimate the parameters and underlying AIF of the reference tissues. The method is computationally efficient and the estimated AIF is smooth and can have higher temporal resolution than the original data. Simulations suggest that this method can provide a reliable estimate of the AIF for DCE-MRI data with a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and temporal resolution, and its performance increases significantly as the SNR and temporal resolution increase. As demonstrated by its clinical application, sufficient reference tissues can be easily obtained from normal tissues and subregions segmented from a tumor region of interest (ROI), which suggests this method can be generally applied to cancer-based DCE-MRI studies to estimate the AIF.

Specifically, the process of decision-making is implemented in a multi-stage and collaborative fashion: Given a classifier for single modality, the classifier is regarded as a virtual expert since classification methods can make emotion recognition in accordance with certain expertise. Then, in the reputation equalization, the expert's classification capability is then quantitatively equalized to assure the reputation and/or confidence for each expert.

Nowadays, extensive processes of globalization, informatization and virtualization have captured all spheres of modern life. These processes require the transition from the traditional knowledge-reproductive training of specialists to the activity focused model in higher school. To implement such a transition, it is necessary to reconsider the organization and methods for student knowledge acquisition of the content of educational programs. The transition has to be centred on the subject of development and knowledge. The aim of the paper is to discuss methodological aspects related to the construction of subject-centred content of higher education and to show its pedagogical capabilities. Methodology and research methods . The methodological framework of the study is performed with the involvement of the regulators of human cognitivetransformational activity, based on the post-non-classical paradigm of cognition; the key principles of the competency-based, activity and personal-centred approaches to training. Theoretical, discursive types of the analysis, content analysis, modelling of pedagogical systems and processes were used to design a conceptual plan of the research and develop its empirical base. Methods of the comparative analysis, synthesis and generalization of practical experience were applied at the stage of an experiment; the hypertext training program was applied during approbation of the developed model for training content. Results and scientific novelty. The essence of the subject-centred approach to designing the content of the higher education was summarized. It is noted that a cognitive component of vocational training is transformed to semantic reality by means of the subject-centred approach. The key concepts of \u201csubject\u201d, \u201csubjectivity\u201d and \u201csubject experience\u201d were clarified from the didactic point of view. The research demonstrates the fundamental difference of the content of a new type from its traditional model where it is considered as an object of acquisition, and from the understanding of the content in the activity concept which provides a way (principle) of activity as its elementary unit. A basic unit of the subjectcentred content of the vocational training is the information resource to be transformed by the subject of the education (a student) to personal knowledge through the following this occupation. The student is a self-conscious member of the information and communication process. Based on the subject and author's representations and estimations which provide constructive interaction with the dynamically changing environment, a future expert generates information relying on wellknown knowledge and learns to apply it in a concrete context, getting social, cultural and professional experience. In this regard, a teacher is not an educational content carrier, but a network of hypermedia texts with architectonic-structural points (information hubs) of axiological knowledge. The role of the teacher consists not in formal transfer of the factual material, but assistance with student independent designing and realization of productive capabilities of students. The two-tiered structure of information resource was described. This structure is caused by the unity of the principles of fundamental nature and professional orientation. The script model of the student experience is schematically shown; the logic of training has to comply with the model outlined. The model of subject-centred content of education demonstrating its procedural character and activity form is presented. Practical significance . The author has proposed a new system organization of the content of higher education using the possibilities of hypertext systems. The proposed system can become the basis for the self-development of future professionals, their mobility in the labour market and the maximum self-realization in the chosen sphere of employment.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2907116522", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203685559"}

Since the full build of large software systems can take hours, the incremental build is a cornerstone of modern build systems. Incremental builds should only recompile deliverables whose dependencies have been changed by a developer. However, in many organizations, such dependencies still are identified by build rules that are specified and maintained (mostly) manually, typically using technologies like make. Incomplete rules lead to unspecified dependencies that can prevent certain deliverables from being rebuilt, yielding incomplete results, which leave sources and deliverables out-of-sync. In this paper, we present a case study on unspecified dependencies in the make-based build systems of the glib, openldap, linux and qt open source projects. To uncover unspecified dependencies in make-based build systems, we use an approach that combines a conceptual model of the dependencies specified in the build system with a concrete model of the files and processes that are actually exercised during the build. Our approach provides an overview of the dependencies that are used throughout the build system and reveals unspecified dependencies that are not yet expressed in the build system rules. During our analysis, we find that unspecified dependencies are common.

RIM was originally developed for the mining industry; we are applying the method to a biomedical measurement because of its simplicity, economy, and safety. When a two-dimensional image was constructed from the measured data, the method provided insufficient resolution because the wavelength of the measurement medium, a weak electromagnetic wave in a VHF band, was longer than human tissues. We built and measured a phantom, a model simulating the human body, consisting of two water tanks representing large internal organs. A digital equalizer was applied to the measured values as a weight function, and images were reconstructed that corresponded to the original shape of the two water tanks. As a result, a two-dimensional image containing two individual peaks corresponding to the original two small water tanks was constructed. The result suggests the method was applicable to biomedical measurement by the assistance of digital signal processing.

Threshold concepts are specific concepts which are identified as essential in the acquisition of thinking, learning and communication of understanding within a specific subject of learning. Threshold experiences occur when learners identify moments of \u201clearning leaps\u201d which are cognitive transformations or changes in conceptual role for the learner, enabling them to work at higher levels of abstraction and creativity. Virtual reality technology is increasingly applied in education and can be used to test multiple threshold concepts and applied to open problems that allow for low-stress and real-time interactions as well as supporting collaborative groups with rapid interactions. Applications built on VR can engage, immerse, and guide learners in ways not yet undertaken in the education of threshold concepts. Through literature review we explore the definitions of threshold concepts, VR technologies, and the opportunities for teaching threshold concepts using VR technologies.

The lack of response to therapy is currently assessed after multiple months of cytotoxic therapy, driving the critical need to develop pretreatment clinic-biological biomarkers that can guide precise and effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, our guiding hypothesis is that PRN has distinct biological features present at diagnosis that can be identified for prediction modeling. During a visual analysis of PRN slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, we observed that patients who survived for less than three years contained large eosin-stained structures as compared to those who survived for greater than three years.

To test this hypothesis, we developed an image analysis method that performs stain separation, followed by the detection of large structures stained with Eosin.

Per- ceived image quality is influenced by a number of quality at- tributes. Evaluation of all attributes influence, and their influence on other attributes, is is a difficult and complex task. Because of this the most important attributes should be identified in order to achieve a more effective and manageable evaluation of image quality. In this paper we identify and categorize existing quality attributes, and we propose a refined selection of meaningful qual- ity attributes for the evaluation of color prints. Experimental data verify the proposed set of quality attributes. the IQ of different printing systems. IQ models have been created to establish a link between sub- jective and objective IQ. These models are theories of perception that enable the prediction of IQ (10). They are intended to de- scribe the overall IQ and to help researchers in the evaluation of IQ. IQ models are composed of QAs, and they show how QAs relate to each other and their influence on overall IQ. The goal for IQ models is to evaluate all QAs and their relationships, yet, this is a very difficult and complex task. In order to reduce the com- plexity most IQ models use a subset of QAs composed of the most important QAs. A subset of QAs can be defined based on tech- nological issues, or by asking observers, or by a combination of the two. By defining a subset of QAs, strengths and weaknesses of a given system can be meaningfully represented with a rela- tively small number of QAs (11). Several IQ models have been proposed (3, 8, 12, 13), but the search for better and improved IQ models is still ongoing. The goal of this paper is to identify and categorize existing QAs to propose a refined selection of meaningful QAs for the evaluation of color prints. These QAs can further be used to cre- ate a link between subjective and objective IQ in an IQ model. Identification and categorization of QAs can be used as assistance in the evaluation of color prints, as well as to improve or develop new evaluation methods. This paper is organized as follows: First a survey of QAs and IQ models, then a discussion about the selection of important QAs for the evaluation of color prints. Next, an experiment investigat- ing a color workflow is carried out, where QAs are evaluated by observers.

The LPA-ICI algorithm is nonlinear and spatially adaptive with respect to smoothness and irregularities of the image corrupted by additive noise. Multiresolution wavelet algorithms produce estimates which are combined from different scale projections. In contrast to them, the proposed ICI algorithm gives a varying scale adaptive estimate defining a single best scale for each pixel. In the new algorithm, the actual filtering is performed in signal domain while frequency domain Fourier transform operations are applied only for calculation of convolutions.

Then empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was employed to represent the sEMG as IMF components, of which the time-domain features (ZC and WAMP) were obtained. Then PCA was used to reduce the dimension of feature set. The optimal training set of similar grasping gestures was determined by adjusting the weight of sEMG feature in the feature space.

Several QoS frameworks have been developed and standardized to satisfy these QoS requirements. Among them is the NSIS QoS framework that is currently being standardized by the NSIS (Next Steps In Signaling) working group within IETF. Each communication node or a domain on the path that supports the NSIS QoS framework is expected to support a QoS Model (QOSM) appropriate to the characteristics of its underlying technology. One of these QOSMs is the Resource Management in Diffserv QOSM (RMD-QOSM). RMD-QOSM is based on the reduced-state QoS concept meaning that RMD-QOSM aware interior nodes maintain per Diffserv-class reservation states instead of per flow reservation states. The reduced-state operation has many advantages, among which are scalability and flexibility, but it also results in complex handling of severe congestion situations. A severe congestion may occur when a router or link fails and the traffic is rerouted through another router or link which may become severely overloaded. This paper focuses on the investigation and evaluation of severe congestion handling solutions applied in a RMD-QOSM aware domain which supports bidirectional reservations initiated and maintained by preemption aware services.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comcom.2008.04.031", "venue": "Comput.

One megabit per second per student is the current \"magic number\" in school network design. It is the long-term goal set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and originally established by the State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) as the 2017 goal for Internet capacity in educational settings. It is about the same capacity per user offered in the most basic of consumer cable plans, and an order of magnitude less than what many families need for modern Internet use. This \"modern use\" includes streaming video, interactive content and fast Web browsing by multiple family members simultaneously. One megabit per second per student is also a number that only 15 percent of school districts can currently meet, according to CoSN's 2014 E-Rate and Infrastructure Survey. In fact, this modest broadband goal is so overwhelming to achieve that many districts cite the financial obstacle as the primary reason they don't embark on a digital transformation for their schools and their students. Reaching this goal seems outrageously ambitious to many district IT and financial leaders, particularly those in large districts. Do Schools Really Need That Much Bandwidth? According to the CoSN Smart Education Networks by Design (SEND) initiative's work with leading districts, the answer is: absolutely! School districts can get by for a long time with limited bandwidth and lackluster network design if they are not shifting to the student-centered teaching and learning enabled by personal devices. But once a district commits to digital transformation, new demands are placed on their technological infrastructure, and those demands begin to grow non-linearly. And will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The first phenomenon many districts encounter is that no matter how much bandwidth they provide, it's simply not enough. It often takes years for districts to reach a minimal level of capacity where the network itself is no longer the bottleneck for student access to the Internet and their cloud-based resources. Yet as the district adds capacity, student use of their devices explodes to take advantage of the new digital capacity and access to online resources. Often, the district will then take a look at the usage and decide to double the capacity the following year--once again with the same result. Student usage immediately swamps the network capacity. During the planning process, it may often seem as though there is adequate network capacity, but this is an illusion. As students begin to increase their usage, the network becomes slow and congested, which causes them to back off their usage at school. Students then wait until they get to a place with more capacity, such as at home or a Starbucks, to fully use their devices. Likewise, teachers back off on the kinds of digital work they ask students to do in the classroom, since they don't want to waste instructional minutes on getting everyone logged on a creeping network. The network is used less, and so the capacity levels seem acceptable. Successful districts monitor their networks carefully in order to determine when they need more capacity. They look at the average bandwidth usage, but also look carefully at peak loads. There are certain times of day--such as when classes start or end and all students are told to log on or off their devices and digital content at the same time--when there is always a spike in demand on the network. A key question is this: How close does the spike come to 100 percent of the network's capacity? Does it get so high that teachers and students are at risk for backing off their technology usage? In North Carolina, for example, the state education network increases capacity to a district when they find that it exceeds 60 percent capacity more than 85 percent of the time. \u2026", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "T.H.E.

The expressions are approximated while they are computed, so that only those terms are generated which remain in the final expression. This principle causes drastic savings in CPU time and memory, compared with previous symbolic analysis tools. In this way, the maximum size of circuits that can be analyzed, is largely increased. By taking into account a range for the value of a circuit parameter rather than one single number, the generated expressions are also more generally valid. Mismatch handling is explicitly taken into account in the algorithm. The capabilities of the new tool are illustrated with several experimental results. >", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/4.364450", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits", "mag_id": "2139100131", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51921142"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214800586"}

These operators allow to specify whether an entity, belonging to a class, is typical or not.

These properties are used as a set of axioms which allows to define the topological inclusion and membership relations.

We make the first attempt to address the problem through a novel and unified framework that recovers hidden scene structures without ordering and amodal annotations as supervisions. This is achieved via Partial Completion Network (PCNet)-mask (M) and -content (C), that learn to recover fractions of object masks and contents, respectively, in a self-supervised manner. Based on PCNet-M and PCNet-C, we devise a novel inference scheme to accomplish scene de-occlusion, via progressive ordering recovery, amodal completion and content completion. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to other alternatives. Remarkably, our approach that is trained in a self-supervised manner achieves comparable results to fully-supervised methods.

CloTT has previously been shown to enjoy a number of syntactic properties including strong normalisation, canonicity and decidability of the equational theory. In this paper we present a denotational semantics for CloTT useful, e.g., for studying future extensions of CloTT with constructions such as path types. The main challenge for constructing this model is to model the notion of ticks on a clock used in CloTT for coinductive reasoning about coinductive types. We build on a category previously used to model guarded recursion with multiple clocks. In this category there is an object of clocks but no object of ticks, and so tick-assumptions in a context can not be modelled using standard tools. Instead we model ticks using dependent right adjoint functors, a generalisation of the category theoretic notion of adjunction to the setting of categories with families. Dependent right adjoints are known to model Fitch-style modal types, but in the case of CloTT, the modal operators constitute a family indexed internally in the type theory by clocks. We model this family using a dependent right adjoint on the slice category over the object of clocks. Finally we show how to model the tick constant of CloTT using a semantic substitution.

Central to achieving this is how the agents coordinate. One way to coordinate is by learning to communicate with each other. Can the agents develop a language while learning to perform a common task? In this paper, we formulate and study a MARL problem where cooperative agents are connected to each other via a fixed underlying network. These agents can communicate along the edges of this network by exchanging discrete symbols. However, the semantics of these symbols are not predefined and, during training, the agents are required to develop a language that helps them in accomplishing their goals. We propose a method for training these agents using emergent communication. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework by applying it to the problem of managing traffic controllers, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance as compared to a number of strong baselines. More importantly, we perform a detailed analysis of the emergent communication to show, for instance, that the developed language is grounded and demonstrate its relationship with the underlying network topology.

Linking up height information from digital elevation models to measurements on aerial photographs always involves an interpolation procedure. The procedures most often used in practice are of an iterative nature. In the PC digitizing environment, this procedure makes it difficult to transfer measurements from the photograph immediately to georeferenced coordinates, due to the mathematical relationships of an aerial photograph. At the Wageningen Agricultural University, a simple and exact interpolation method has been developed to fit the online digitizing requirements and speed up batch coordinate transfer operations when working with aerial photographs. INTRODUCTION In the field of digital mapping when working from single aerial photographs (MONOPLOTTING), one has always had to deal with the problem of interpolating height information before getting a satisfactory result. At the Wageningen Agricultural University (W AU), monoplotting in a PC environment has been used in several research projects to get basemap material for these projects and to acquire primary data for GIS program packages. Many typical photogrammetric steps in the monoplotting process are considered by non-photogrammetric users to be a problem. The main photogrammetric problems for these users are: getting ground control points for the photo block adjustment. carrying out and computing the photo block adjustment. measuring and computing a sufficiently accurate digital elevation model (DEM). interpolating the height from the DEM with sufficient accuracy in all terrain relief types. At the Department of Landsurveying and Remote Sensing of the W A U programs have either been made or bought to assist the non-photogrammetric user in carrying out and solving the first three problems. However the last problem caused extra data handling, relatively long computation times and problems in areas with extreme terrain relief. In this paper the mathematical approach and some of the applications will be explained of the developed interpolation. 951 BASIC MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS To understand this interpolation approach, knowledge of the principles of the relationship of a single aerial photograph and a given georeference is necessary. When a photograph is made [5], a ray of light reflected by a terrain object P, goes through the atmosphere and the camera's lens system to hit the film at the image point p (see Fig. 1). To describe the relationship between terrain object P and the image point p, we assume they are connected by a straight line through the optical centre 0 of the camera I s lens system [2,3]. This assumption is . sufficient for most applications for which the monoplottmg system has been designed.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "163385927", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["126475039"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127564035"}

We also present a technique for abstract representation of the sequences, based on the empirically determined variable length patterns within the audit sequence, and explore the usage of such representation for detecting anomalies in sequences. Our methodology for anomaly detection takes two factors into account: the presence of individual malicious motifs, and the spatial relationships between the motifs that are present in a sequence. Thus, our method subsumes most of the past works, which primarily based on only the first factor.

In this paper, we introduce LinZinc, a new library for Zinc which includes necessary functions to linearize high-level data structures and expressions in Zinc models. The interesting point is that, thanks to the extensibility of Zinc, LinZinc is written in Zinc itself instead of being implemented in the compiler. We have used LinZinc for linearizing a set of well-known nonlinear models. The experimental results show that on the one hand, there is no signi\ufb01cant overhead in linearizing models and, on the other hand, the linearized models are sometimes faster than the original models.

The proposed network can automatically learn features from complex hyperspectral image data structures. Furthermore, skip connection parameters are added between the encoder layer and decoder layer in order to make the network suitable for semi-supervised learning.

In twenty-two articles written by established corpus linguists, members of the ICAME (International Computer Archive of Modern and Mediaeval English) association, this new volume brings the reader up to date with the cycle of activities which make up this field of study as it is today, dealing with corpus creation, language varieties, diachronic corpus study from the past to present, present-day synchronic corpus study, the web as corpus, and corpus linguistics and grammatical theory. It thus serves as a valuable guide to the state of the art for linguistic researchers, teachers and language learners of all persuasions. After over twenty years of evolution, corpus linguistics has matured, incorporating nowadays not just small, medium and large primary corpus building but also specialised and multi-dimensional secondary corpus building; not just corpus analysis, but also corpus evaluation; not just an initial application of theory, but self-reflection and a new concern with theory in the light of experience. The volume also highlights the growing emphasis on language as a changing phenomenon, both in terms of established historical study and the newer short-range diachronic study of 20th century and current English; and the growing area of overlap between these two. Another section of the volume illustrates the recent changes in the definition of \u2018corpus\u2019 which have come about due to the emergence of new technologies and in particular of the availability of texts on the world wide web.

It is protected by cryptographic and network security techniques, but they are vulnerable to internal and external attacks.

The standard coding procedure consists in assigning one or more ICD codes to a patient's hospital visit: this operation is performed by medical coders, who read and review the clinical notes written by physicians and then assign the appropriate ICD codes according to the coding guidelines. This process can be time consuming and error-prone. With the rising popularity of electronic health records (EHRs) systems for the automated reading of the clinical notes and codes assignment have been proposed in the recent years.

In the long run, intelligent vehicles are expected to work at SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) level 4 or level 5. Researchers should make full use of virtual simulation scenarios to test the visual intelligence algorithms of intelligent vehicles under various imaging conditions. In this paper, we create realistic artificial scenes to simulate the self-driving scenarios, and collect a dataset of synthetic images from the virtual driving scenes, named \u201cParallelEye-CS\u201d. In the artificial scenes, we can flexibly change environmental conditions and automatically acquire accurate and diverse ground-truth labels. As a result, ParallelEye-CS has six ground-truth labels and includes twenty types of tests, which are divided into normal, environmental, and difficult tasks. Furthermore, we utilize ParallelEye-CS in combination with other publicly available datasets to conduct experiments for visual object detection.

Our clinical laboratory implemented capillary electrophoresis using a Sebia\u037e Capillarys-2\u2122 (Norcross, GA, USA) instrument for serum and urine protein electrophoresis. Using Data Innovations Instrument Manager, an interface was established with the LIS (Cerner) that allowed for bi-directional transmission of numeric data. However, the text of the interpretive pathology report was not properly transferred. To reduce manual effort and possibility for error in text data transfer, we developed scripts in AutoHotkey, a free, open-source macro-creation and automation software utility. Materials and Methods: Scripts were written to create macros that automated mouse and key strokes. The scripts retrieve the specimen accession number, capture user input text, and insert the text interpretation in the correct patient record in the desired format. Results: The scripts accurately and precisely transfer narrative interpretation into the LIS. Combined with bar-code reading by the electrophoresis instrument, the scripts transfer data efficiently to the correct patient record. In addition, the AutoHotKey script automated repetitive key strokes required for manual entry into the LIS, making protein electrophoresis sign-out easier to learn and faster to use by the pathology residents. Scripts allow for either preliminary verification by residents or final sign-out by the attending pathologist. Conclusions: Using the open-source AutoHotKey software, we successfully improved the transfer of text data between capillary electrophoresis software and the LIS.

An important aspect of this initiative concerns the force feedback and the ability of the robot to feel the forces that are applied to it. To measure the forces that are exerted on, for instance, a humanoid robot\u2019s wrist, multi-axis force-torque sensors are essential. With these sensors, the robot can detect obstacles, avoid collisions, and get the job safely done. We hypothesize that the ability to accurately detect the force measurements that are associated with force control will help to improve the dexterity of such robots. ::: ::: To this end, we aim to develop new methods for designing the compliant structures that form the core of multi-axis force-torque sensors. The resulting sensors must be highly sensitive to a sufficient range of forces, and they must be capable of measuring forces in all directions. Moreover, they must be compact, so that they can be easily integrated within robotic structures; and of course, they must be cost-effective. This thesis attempts to answer three questions: 1)What is the best performance index for evaluating the geometry of the compliant structure? 2)What is the best systematic method to use for designing the mechanical structure? and 3) What is the best transduction technique for achieving a compact sensor design? ::: ::: We began our research by investigating the geometric model of the sensor, to better understand the equations by which the force and torque are computed. Based on this analysis, we proposed two performance indices, which we then validated. We next investigated how the behavior and the mechanical proprieties of the structure can be used to convey accurate estimates of the forces. Through an advanced systematic design method, based on a symbolic formulation of the wrench-displacement relationship, we designed a compact and cost-effective triaxial force sensor. Our sensor uses a single capacitive sensing element to detect several forces efficiently. In order to improve the design of the sensing element, we proposed a new transduction technique. This technique allowed us to build a multi-axial sensing element that is able to separate stress components of normal stress, shear stress, and torque. This innovative use of a single multi-axial sensing element allowed us to reduce the size of the network of sensing elements, and consequently lower the total dimensions and cost of the multi-axis force-torque sensor. In a series of experiments, we verified that our multi-axial sensing element can successfully measure multiple forces, proving that it is ready for use in numerous robotic applications.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2338788273", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:170901357"}

For the first time, aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the Rosetta@home distributed computing network. Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. These results indicate that refinement with an all-atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions.

The result is that a surprisingly simple off-line recognizer, which is weak on its own, produces nearly the best recognition rate in combination with other evaluation factors in remarkably small space-and-time complexity. Generally, lower dimensions with fewer principal components produce a smaller set of prototypes, which reduces memory-cost and time-cost. This degrades the recognition rate, however, so we need to reach a compromise. In an evaluation function with the above-mentioned multiple factors combined, the configuration of only 50 dimensions with as few as 5 principal components for the off-line recognizer keeps almost the best accuracy 98.23% (the best accuracy 98.34%) for text recognition while it reduces the total memory-cost to 1/3 (from 99.4MB down to 32MB) and the average time-cost of character recognition for text recognition to 4/5 (from 0.1672ms to 0.1349ms per character) compared with the traditional off-line recognizer with 160 dimensions and 50 principal components.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2013.08.014", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

Even though there are several established drugs in clinical use for malaria treatment, there is an urgent need for new drugs acting through novel mechanisms of action due to the rapid development of resistance. Resistance emerges when the parasite manages to mutate the sequence of the drug targets to the extent that the protein can still perform its function in the parasite but can no longer be inhibited by the drug, which then becomes almost ineffective. The design of a new generation of malaria drugs targeting multiple essential proteins would make it more difficult for the parasite to develop full resistance without lethally disrupting some of its vital functions. The challenge is then to identify which set of Plasmodium falciparum proteins, among the millions of possible combinations, can be targeted at the same time by a given chemotype. To do that, we predicted first the targets of the close to 20,000 antimalarial hits identified recently in three independent phenotypic screening campaigns. All targets predicted were then projected onto the genome of P. falciparum using orthologous relationships. A total of 226 P. falciparum proteins were predicted to be hit by at least one compound, of which 39 were found to be significantly enriched by the presence and degree of affinity of phenotypically active compounds. The analysis of the chemically compatible target combinations containing at least one of those 39 targets led to the identification of a priority set of 64 multi-target profiles that can set the ground for a new generation of more robust malaria drugs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3798273", "pubmed_id": "24146604", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003257", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1992120716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202802991", "17383711", "16643632", "215493584", "215028362", "1656553", "10726621", "18157299", "16140174", "18838725", "214852996", "37695830", "7467257", "7544765", "213472763", "51864885", "73537347", "14529813"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17476750"}

The importance of decision making in cost and duration estimation for building design processes points to a need for an estimation tool for both designers and project managers. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), as the tools of soft computing techniques, offer significant potential in this field. This study presents the proposal of an approach to the estimation of construction costs and duration of construction projects, which is based on PSO approach. The general applicability of PSO in the formulated problem with cost and duration estimation is examined. A series of 60 projects collected from constructed government projects were utilized to build the proposed models. Eight input parameters, such as volume of bricks, the volume of concrete, footing type, elevators number, total floors area, area of the ground floor, floors number, and security status are used in building the proposed model. The results displayed that the PSO models can be an alternative approach to evaluate the cost and-or duration of construction projects. The developed model provides high prediction accuracy, with a low mean (0.97 and 0.99) and CoV (10.87% and 4.94%) values.

The WMA is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the mating behavior of woodpeckers. It was inspired by the drumming sound intensity. In WMA, the population of woodpeckers is divided into male and female groups. The female woodpeckers approach the male woodpeckers based on the intensity of their drum sound. An efficiency comparison was drawn between the WMA algorithm and other metaheuristic algorithms by employing 19 benchmark functions(including unimodal, multimodal and composite functions). Moreover, the performance of WMA is compared with 8 of the best meta-heuristic algorithms using 13 high dimensional multimodal and unimodal benchmark functions. The assessments and statistical results indicate that the WMA algorithm offers promising results and is capable of outperforming the most recent and popular algorithms proposed in the literature in most of the employed benchmark functions.

Thus, data centers face the challenge to provide always more services at higher data rates while reacting quickly to complex failures and more powerful attacks thanks to efficient network forensics. Moreover, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) becomes a standard which offers agility but also requires forensic devices able to handle multiple configurations. Although conventional software probes are programmable and thus agile, they cannot support high data rate packet processing any more. Probes could benefit from Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) to cope with high data rates, but ASICs development time of many months makes them unable to satisfy agility requirements. With reconfiguration ability and high throughput processing without packet loss, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are the key technology chosen by some companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon and OVH, to be integrated into smart Network Interface Cards (NIC). Nevertheless, while high performance criteria is fulfilled, current FPGA probes benefit from an agility still limited to their conventional firmware upgrades which require proprietary tools and hardware-design time and knowledge. This paper proposes the first solution to offer FPGA probes with runtime agility thanks to a flexible packet parser which can be parameterized continuously by a software, endorsing complex tasks and SDN control. This allows a live adaptation of protocol processings from computer host alongside handling packets at line rate without data loss. The proposed parser is open-source and easily usable by network engineers through a Python software API. Benchmark results illustrate the performance of the agile high-level probe implemented on a NetFPGA SUME board, with XC7VX690T FPGA. 60 millions of 64-byte packets are counted based on features provided at runtime. These are selected by the software part, allowing the detection of different volumetric attacks within a few tens of microseconds.

Although wind energy certainly has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future world energy supply, a number of challenges are still to be met in wind turbine technology.

Thorough understanding of these loads is a prerequisite to further increase the overall reliability of a wind turbine. Hence, improved insight in the component structural dynamics could eventually lead to more cost-effective wind turbines. This paper addresses the use of dynamic substructuring (DS) as an analysis tool in wind turbine engineering. The benefits of a component-wise approach to structural dynamic analysis are illustrated, as well as a number of practical issues that need to be tackled for successful application of substructuring techniques in an engineering setting.

The proposed approach makes use only of information that is readily available from public repositories and it is easily expandable to handle novel sources of information. We assess the classification capabilities of GOTA on a large benchmark set of publications. The overall performances are encouraging in comparison to the state of the art in multi-label classification over large taxonomies.

For coded BICM systems, receivers need to employ max log MAP demodulators (demappers) that calculate soft-decision metrics i.e. log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the decoder. The complexity of the calculation of these LLRs is exponential in the number of bits per symbol and moreover for systems exploiting spatial dimension (MIMO), the complexity further increases exponentially in the number of transmit antennas. In this paper we propose matched filter (MF) based low complexity max log MAP bit metrics for BICM single input single output (SISO) and low dimensional BICM MIMO systems using Gray encoded $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) alphabets. For SISO systems, the maximum likelihood (ML) detector needs computation and comparison of minimum distances between the received symbol and $M$ constellation points on the complex plane for the calculation of each LLR. In this paper we show that these LLRs can be computed precisely from the MF output and therefore do not necessitate any minimum distance calculations. For low dimensional BICM MIMO systems, we further propose a MF based bit metric which successfully trims down one complex dimension of the system thereby reducing complexity. Both these metrics substantially reduce the number of calculations needed for each LLR without compromising the performance and MF being an integral part of all receiver structures facilitates their hardware implementation. Simulation results over Rayleigh fading channels verify similar performance of the simplified metrics as those of the original metrics but with a significant reduction in the complexity.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493934", "venue": "2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference", "journal": "2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165458757", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63822191", "47535465", "9425808", "7875258", "6157164"], "inbound_citations": ["115675377", "36385049", "15597773", "4905495", "143427639", "4866937", "55648276", "3613778", "2377607", "7982626", "143430621", "3904592", "27688904", "21715314"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6277339"}

No appearance features are required by our method. Display Omitted This work considers the task of object proposal scoring by integrating the consistency between state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms. It represents a novel way of thinking about proposals, as it starts with the assumption that consistent proposals are most likely centered on objects in the image. We pose the box-consistency problem as a large-scale regression task. The approach starts from existing popular object proposal algorithms and assigns scores to these proposals based on the consistency within and between algorithms. Rather than generating new proposals, we focus on the consistency of state-of-the-art ones and score them on the assumption that mutually agreeing proposals usually indicate the location of objects. This work performs large-scale regression by starting from the strong Gaussian Process model, renowned for its power as a regressor. We extend the model in a natural manner to make effective use of the large number of training samples. We achieve this through metric learning for reshaping the kernel space, while maintaining the kernel-matrix size fixed. We validated the new Gaussian Process models on a standard regression dataset - Airfoil Self-Noise - to prove the generality of the method. Furthermore, we test the suitability of the proposed approach for the undertaken box scoring task on Pascal-VOC2007. We conclude that box scoring is possible by employing overlap statistics in a new Gaussian Process model, fine tuned to handle large amounts of data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2016.05.002", "venue": "Comput.

Unfortunately, today, there is often still a gap between the design of numerical algorithms and the characteristics of the hardware on which the algorithms are executed. For the solution of a particular sub problem of a two-phase flow problem, we develop a numerical algorithm that aims to match the architecture of a cluster of nodes with multi-core chips. The algorithm is concerned with the re-initialization of level set function used to keep track of the interface between two phases of a fluid. It consists of a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization strategy, using a domain decomposition approach on the outermost level of parallelization. On the inner level, a parallel region handles an individual sub domain. So, a domain decomposition approach based on MPI is combined with an OpenMP approach leading to a hybrid distributed-/shared-memory parallelization.

Consequently, counteracting the insider threat involves influencing the insider\u2019s perceptions and behaviour in order to ensure compliance. When an individual\u2019s actions and beliefs are incongruent, this induces a phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. In order to reduce this dissonance, individuals are self-motivated either to change their behaviours or beliefs, or to rationalize their behaviour. Neutralization is a technique used by criminals to rationalize maleficence. In terms of the insider threat, it has been proposed that if the justifications for committing an offence are eliminated, then the insider is less likely to commit the offence. This process is known as neutralization mitigation. The research reported on here proposes that inducing cognitive dissonance may be a means of mitigating the neutralizations that the insider may use to justify maleficence. To integrate these concepts into a pragmatic implementable solution the Insider Threat Neutralization Mitigation model predicated on Cognitive Dissonance (ITNMCD) is proposed.

An appropriate limit for rates achievable under delay constraints is the delay limited capacity (DLC). In this work, the DLC of OFDM systems is investigated. Despite its complicated correlation structure the OFDM DLC is fully characterized for low and high SNR. It is shown that (under weak assumptions) the OFDM DLC is almost independent of the fading distribution in the low SNR region but strongly depends on the delay spread thereby achieving a capacity gain over AWGN capacity. In the high SNR region the roles are exchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of the fading distribution becomes dominant. The relevant quantities and their asymptotic behaviour are derived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation structure. Using a general convergence framework the analysis further shows that if the delay spread becomes large even the predominant impact of the fading distribution vanishes and DLC capacity loss compared to AWGN capacity approaches 0.58[nats/s/Hz]. The convergence speed, the loss due to non-uniform power delay profile, and the relation to ergodic capacity is also analyzed and underlined with simulations and application examples. The main conclusion here is that OFDM fully takes advantage of the degrees of freedom of the underlying fading channel in terms of delay spread and, regardless of the fading distribution, delay sensitive capacity measures such as the DLC converge to the ergodic capacity. Finally, since universal bounds are obtained which apply to any fading distribution the results can also be used for other classes of parallel channels extending the range of applicability.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2009.080991", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2141478178", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14400950", "17585282", "195862293", "13568646", "61788826", "1897232", "13097571", "18057848"], "inbound_citations": ["19267217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24386289"}

A method of prediction modeling was developed using a neural network, which makes it possible to model a nonlinear system and the LMBP algorithm was used to training the neural networks. RTT and PLR data was collected by the TFRC transmission method, which is a kind of adaptive transmission control based on UDP, and used as the training data for the neural network prediction model. Through the training of the neural network, the prediction model can predict the RTT and PLR after one step. It can also be seen that the error in the predicted values is small.

Like most editors I probably delude myself that JRSM readers read much more of the journal than that. But if you were to only read two articles in this month's issue, I have my recommendations ready for you. ::: ::: A scandal in the House of Lords about peers accepting payment to influence legislation has exposed the fallacy of impartiality that is often associated with government and politicians. A few weeks before that scandal broke, I agreed to publish an editorial by Richard Smith and colleagues about the fallacy of impartiality in academic publications (JRSM 2009;102:44\u201345 ). ::: ::: The authors argue that competing interests in academic publications have become focused on the view that authors linked to for\u2010profit companies are heavily conflicted whereas those associated with the public sector and academic institutions are not. Indeed, why are representatives of government, royal colleges, medical societies and trade unions any less motivated by personal success or the success of their organizations than employees of companies and businesses? Moreover, the lack of transparency about the competing interests of public sector and academic institutions leaves them hostage to the hidden influences of powerful lobbying groups and organizations, as well as individual whims and fancies. ::: ::: \u2018Our message is simple,\u2019 say Smith and colleagues. \u2018A view of the world that sees employees of private for\u2010profit companies as conflicted and doctors, or employees of public or academic bodies as not, is naive, potentially deceptive, and likely to distort reader response to new information.\u2019 ::: ::: New information in surgery is sometimes revolutionary but often hard to substantiate with a robust study that would satisfy epidemiologists and methodologists. Peter McCulloch readily recognizes the difficulty of moving from proof of concept to trial development in surgery (JRSM 2009;102:51\u201355 ). Yet he argues that the real\u2010life development of surgical techniques shows a clear series of phases, which differ importantly from those in classical drug development. McCulloch goes further by proposing new reporting guidelines, modifications to randomized controlled trials, and novel study designs to address current difficulties in allowing evaluation to reach the stage of a randomized controlled trial. ::: ::: Finally \u2013 and yes I know this is a third article \u2013 if you would rather listen rather than read, you might consider the review on general medical podcasts (JRSM 2009;102:69\u201374 ). Many readers will be blissfully unaware of the upsurge in podcasts, an online audio recording, from medical publications. Will podcasts revolutionize medical communication? My own view is that the quality of medical journal podcasts has been amateurish and they have failed to add sufficient value. ::: ::: Is this a failure of the promise of the Internet? Possibly. But the Internet has been successful in exposing hidden competing interests, whether associated with private for\u2010profit, public sector, or academic organizations.

The present study examined if body image concerns (e.g., appearance and weight esteem) mediate the relationship between excessive time spent on SNS and disordered eating behaviors (restrained and emotional eating). The sample included 383 (70.2 percent female) undergraduate students (mean age = 23.08 years, standard deviation = 3.09) who completed self-report questionnaires related to SNS engagement, body image, disordered eating behaviors, and demographics. Parallel multiple mediation and moderated mediation analyses revealed that lower weight and appearance esteem mediated the relationship between excessive time on SNS and restrained eating for males and females, whereas appearance esteem mediated the relationship between excessive time on SNS and emotional eating for females only. The study adds to the literature by highlighting mediational pathways and gender differences.

Exploration is concentrated south-east of Cerro Prieto where hot water and steam at high temperature and pressure are present in the reservoir. To the north and south of Cerro Prieto there are three further areas of surface manifestations. During the period from the beginning of 1968 to August 1969, the Research Institute for the Electrical Industry, a branch of the Federal Electricity Commission, has carried out geological, geophysical, and geochemical studies in four geothermal fields in the central volcanic belt, located approximately between parallels 18 and 21 north latitude, and composed of volcanic rocks of ages ranging from Tertiary to Recent. All of them have very good contrast in their physiographic expression, intimately connected with active volcanic and tectonic zones of Mexico. The fields of Los Negritos and Ixtlan de los Hervores, State of Michoacan, (1535 metres a.m.s.l.) are at the intersection of the western Sierra Madre and the west-central part of the neovolcanic axis. They are about 27 km apart and separated by the Pajacuaran Ridge, on the eastern side of Lake Chapala, 130 km east of Guadalajara. The lake Chapala region is structurally a tectonic trench formed by the Chapala-Acambay system of E-W faults, partially covered by lacustrian sediments and pyroclastic materials. It is a very rich agricultural valley, and there are zones of intense surface thermal activity in areas of recent volcanic activity. The field of Los Humeros, State of Puebla, (2700 metres a.m.s.l.) is at the center of a caldera in the eastern part cf the neovolcanic axis, and the activity consists of dry steam manifestations distributed along three small N-S faults. In these three areas, geological mapping (photogeology and surface sampling) surface temperature, heat flux and resistivity surveys, and also chemical sampling, have been completed. Los Azufres (2800 metres a.m.s.l.) is the highest and most mountainous of these geothermal fields. Preliminary surveys have been made of some hot springs and fumaroles, including temperature measurements, chemical sampling, photogeology, and establishment of a network of benchmarks.

Traditional content providers rely on centralised client-server model for distributing their video streaming content. The current generation is moving from being passive viewers, or content consumers, to active content producers, and the traditional content distribution infrastructure needs to change and adapt. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have proven to be a valuable solution for distributing content to a wide audience. However, they have been designed for file-sharing, and therefore require enhancements and modifications to fulfill the needs of video streaming distribution. In this thesis, we improve fully distributed P2P streaming systems through the design and evaluation of architectures and algorithms. We focus on three major challenges. First, we address the diversity of devices and connections in today\u2019s Internet by describing the architecture for distributing multi bit-rate streaming content. Secondly, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel P2P streaming protocol specifically crafted to distribute streaming content.

Ten symptomatic OH patients and 8 control subjects were included in this study. One patient was retrospectively excluded because he suffered from multiple system atrophy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes were measured during a tilting bed procedure. Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and mean transit time were determined by bolus-tracking perfusion MRI and correlated with blood pressure changes. Cerebral blood volume was significantly increased in OH patients compared with control subjects for white matter (P = 0.019) and the mean transit time was significantly increased for gray (P = 0.010) and white matter (P = 0.015). The cerebral blood flow of the gray (r = 0.74, P = 0.022) and white matter (r = 0.75, P = 0.020) was significantly, positively correlated with systolic blood pressure changes. The mean transit time in white matter was significantly, negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure changes (r = \u22120.68, P = 0.045).

IaaS often provides out-of-band remote management using virtual serial consoles (VSCs). Even on failures inside their VMs, users can directly access their systems through a virtual serial device in the management VM. However, the management VM is not always trustworthy in IaaS. Attackers in the management VM can easily eavesdrop on inputs and outputs in remote management. In this paper, we propose SCCrypt for preventing information leakage in out-of-band remote management. SCCrypt provides encrypted VSCs to the management VM. In an encrypted VSC, the trusted virtual machine monitor (VMM) securely decrypts console inputs encrypted in an SSH client. It also encrypts console outputs, which are decrypted in an SSH client. For this purpose, the VMM correctly identifies the inputs and ouputs by tracking device state without the cooperation of the management VM and user VMs. To support a key change at the reconnection to an encrypted VSC, the VMM re-encrypts pending console outputs.

This article presents MintMOS: a lightweight, no-reference, loadable kernel module to infer the QoE of a video stream in transit and offer suggestions to improve it. MintMOS revolves around one-time offline construction of a k-dimensional space, which we call the QoE space. A QoE space is a known characterization of subjective perception for any k parameters (network dependent/ independent) that affect it. We create N partitions of the QoE space by generating N video samples for various values of the k parameters and conducting subjective surveys using them. Every partition then has an expected QoE associated with it. Instantaneous parameters of a real-time video stream are compared to the precomputed QoE space to both infer and offer suggestions to improve QoE. Inferring QoE is a lightweight algorithm that runs in linear time. We implemented MintMOS by creating an actual QoE space using three parameters and 27 partitions by conducting surveys with 77 human subjects. In a second set of surveys using 13 video clips, MintMOS's predictions were compared to 49 human responses.

First, a fire color model is used to extract flame-like pixels as candidate areas in YCbCr space. Second, we convert the candidate regions from the traditional color space into radiation domain in advance by camera calibration. And we use seven features to model the spectral spatio-temporal model of the fire to more accurately characterize the physical and optical properties of the fire. Finally, we choose a two-class SVM classifier to identify the fire from the candidate areas and use a radial basis function kernel to improve the accuracy of the recognition.

It envisaged that the approach would increase the capacity of wireless access networks. Results show that the implementation of multi channels does increase the capacity of access networks. However, the use of either a temporary signalling channel or a dedicated control channel has raised many research questions. The use of a control channel is viewed as a challenge to multi-channel schemes and is considered to be a limiting factor. It has been argued that the capacity of a single dedicated channel causes system bottlenecks as its capacity saturates. Unfortunately, this challenge has been given little attention hence it requires further investigation. This paper explores the saturation problem using the analytical and simulation models. Under the two approaches, the saturation problem is investigated in different scenarios in which the number of data transmitting channels is increased steadily. The investigations show that the capacity of the control channel degrades steadily as the number of channels is increased.

Such a strategy can be considered as a natural solution for preventing data leakage when the manager of the database cannot be entirely trusted or the burden of managing the database needs to be lightened. However, if the database cannot access to this key, it can execute only a few relational algebraic operations by itself, which spoils the serviceability of the database. ::: ::: This paper first introduces the notion of an encryption for controlled joining (ECJ), which enables RDB to execute \"natural join\" of tables when and only when its user required it. This technique can directly be applied for union, difference, and intersection of tables also. Then, the paper proposes an instance under a novel but natural assumption on asymmetric bilinear group. Combining an ECJ with a searchable encryption and an order-preserving encryption, one can construct an encrypted database which can executes the major part of relational algebraic operations. The proposed instance is efficient in a reasonable extent and sacrifices its security only in a minimum extent. We consider such a technique can bring an enhanced security into the database-as-service environment.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-36334-4_4", "venue": "Pairing", "journal": null, "mag_id": "156026352", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3962894", "42119009", "174800293", "18394045", "7123655"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22001216"}

In this, 99.999~ availability is achieved by combining the optical laser beam with an alternate path RF solution. The laser beam of 1550~nm provides high-bandwidth connectivity in majority of the time, whereas the RF path maintains critical network connectivity during extreme weather events that are detrimental to the FSO link, such as thick fog. Optical wireless links suffer from atmospheric loss mainly because of fog, scintillation and precipitation. The authors investigate here the impact of fog, rain and snow effects and evaluate their performances for the optical propagation through the atmosphere.

In order to provide the security and the privacy of RFID users, different authentication protocols have been proposed. In this study, we analyze the privacy of three RFID authentication protocols that proposed recently. For our privacy analysis, we use a formal RFID privacy model which proposed by Ouafi and Phan. It is shown that the privacy of all the analyzed protocols have some problems and cannot provide user privacy. Then, in order to keep and protect the privacy of RFID users, two improved versions of analyzed protocols are proposed which overcome all the existing weaknesses.

Several ICN approaches are based on a flat object ID namespace and require some kind of global name resolution service to translate object IDs into network addresses. Building a world-wide NRS for a flat namespace with 10^1^6 expected IDs is challenging because of requirements such as scalability, low latency, efficient network utilization, and anycast routing that selects the most suitable copies. In this paper, we present a general hierarchical NRS framework for flat ID namespaces. The framework meets those requirements by the following properties: The registration and request forwarding matches the underlying network topology, exploits request locality, supports domain-specific copies of binding entries, can offer constant hop resolution (depending on the chosen underlying forwarding scheme), and provides scoping of publications. Our general NRS framework is flexible and supports different instantiations. These instantiations offer an important trade-off between resolution-domain (i.e. subsystem) autonomy (simplifying deployment) and reduced latency, maintenance overhead, and memory requirements. To evaluate this trade-off and explore the design space, we have designed two specific instantiations of our general NRS framework: MDHT and HSkip. We have performed a theoretical analysis and a simulation-based evaluation of both systems. In addition, we have published an implementation of the MDHT system as open source. Results indicate that an average request latency of (well) below 100ms is achievable in both systems for a global system with 12 million NRS nodes while meeting our other specific requirements. These results imply that a flat namespace can be adopted on a global scale, opening up several design alternatives for information-centric network architectures.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comcom.2013.01.014", "venue": "Comput.

Structural break is one of the important concerns in non-stationary time series prediction.

Our analysis reveals that small pre-break data size or low decay rate will greatly increase the bias of the break location estimation when there is a change of the mean. Based on the analysis, the paper proposes a new statistic SUMSRM to improve the performance of structural break detection and to reduce the bias of break location estimation.

In the proposed method, the interface is composed of straight segments which are part of mesh and move with the flow. This interface representation is an integral part of an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method on an moving adaptive unstructured mesh. Our principal aim is to develop an accurate and robust computational method for interfacial flows driven by strong surface tension and with weak viscous dissipation. We first construct a discrete solutions satisfying the Laplace law on a circular/spherical interfaces exactly, i.e., the balance between the surface tension and the pressure jump across an interface is achieved exactly. The accuracy and stability of these solutions are then investigated for a wide range of Ohnesorge numbers, Oh. The dimensionless amplitude of the spurious current is reduced to machine zero, i.e., on the order of 10 \u2212 15 for Oh \u2265 10 \u2212 3 . Finally, the accuracy and capability of the proposed method are demonstrated through a series of benchmark tests with larger interface deformations. In particular, the method is validated with Prosperitti's analytic results of the bubble/drop oscillations and Peregrine's dripping faucet experiment, in which the values of Oh are small.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109237", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Computational Physics", "mag_id": "3001432628", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213053740"}

Usually, it is performed in a manual way using a Neubauer chamber and expert criterion, with the risk of a high error rate. Scenedesmus algae can build coenobia consisting of 1, 2, 4 and 8 cells. The amount of algae of each coenobium helps to determine the amount of lipids, proteins, and other substances in a given sample of a algae crop. The knowledge of the quantity of those elements improves the quality of bioprocess applications. This paper addresses the methodology for automatic identification of Scenedesmus microalgae (used in the methane production and food industry) and applies it to images captured by a digital microscope. The use of contrast adaptive histogram equalization for pre-processing, and active contours for segmentation are presented. The calculation of statistical features (histogram of oriented gradients, Hu and Zernike moments) with texture features (Haralick and local binary patterns descriptors) are proposed for algae characterization. Classification of coenobia achieves accuracies of 98.63% and 97.32% with support vector machine and artificial neural network, respectively. According to the results, it is possible to consider the proposed methodology as an alternative to the traditional technique for algae counting.

Each local DBMS ensures local serializability. The function of the MDBS is to ensure global serializability. The major difficulty in ensuring global serializability stems from the fact that in the presence of local transactions, and without any restrictions on the local concurrency control of the participating local DBMSs., even serial execution of global transactions does not guarantee global serializability. These difficulties could be avoided if the serialization order of transactions were always the same as their commitment order. The authors study the class of transaction scheduling mechanisms in which transaction serialization order can be determined by controlling their commitment order. They use these results to design a multidatabase transaction management scheme that ensures global serializability. >", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RIDE.1992.227409", "venue": "[1992 Proceedings] Second International Workshop on Research Issues on Data Engineering: Transaction and Query Processing", "journal": "[1992 Proceedings] Second International Workshop on Research Issues on Data Engineering: Transaction and Query Processing", "mag_id": "2160069339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9622223", "167304", "11236545", "8563508", "5036558", "24847203", "18304832", "6287800", "5015318", "9012889", "14648816", "6607650"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:297685"}

In recent years, several strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of the location management procedure in UMTS networks. In this paper, we present a user pattern learning strategy (UPL) using scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) back propagation to reduce the location update signaling cost by increasing the intelligence of the location procedure in UMTS. This strategy associates to each user a list of cells where the user is likely to be with a given probability in each time interval.

Experimental determination of the structure of a protein-DNA complex is an expensive process. Reliable computational methods that utilize the sequence of a DNA-binding protein to predict its DNA-binding interface are needed. Results: We present an application of three machine learning methods: support vector machine, kernel logistic regression, and penalized logistic regression to predict DNA- binding sites on a DNA-binding protein using its amino acid sequence as an input. Prediction is performed using either single sequence or a profile of evolutionary conservation. The performance of our predictors is better than that of other existing sequence-based methods. The outputs of all three individual methods are combined to obtain a consensus prediction. This further improves performance and results in accuracy of 82.4 %, sensitivity of 84.9 % and specificity of 83.1 % for the strict consensus prediction.

It yet remains a challenging problem to work out starting from the conception till implementation. Access control is a study which deals with the ability to permit or deny the access rights to a particular resource (object) by a particular entity (subject). The three most widely implemented traditional access control models are Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Unfortunately, traditional access control solutions are unable to respond adequately to new challenges addressed by modern computer systems. Today highly-distributed, network-connected, heterogeneous and open computing environment needs finegrained, flexible, persistent and continuous protection model of access and usage of digital resources. In this paper, we outline the usage control model [1]\u2013[3], the novel and promising approach for access control in open, distributed, heterogeneous and network-connected computer environment. Usage control model encompasses, systemizes and enhances existing traditional access control models, trust management and digital rights managements in a single framework.

This article surveys the literature on usage control over the period from its birth in 2002 till nowadays. First, we briefly recall existing traditional access control models.

The regularization is achieved by a global shape constraint exploiting a prior reference 3D facial shape. Second, we warp a high-resolution reference 3D face, using both recovered 3D features and local shape constraint at each model points. Last, realistic 3D face is obtained through texture synthesis. Compared with existing approach, the proposed feature recovery method has higher accuracy, and it is robust to facial pose variation appeared on the given image. Moreover, the model warping method based on local shape constraints can warp a high-resolution reference 3D face using few 3D features more reasonably and accurately.

Although dense sampling of local features is useful in achieving an improved performance in image matching and object recognition, it results in increased computational costs for feature extraction. The purpose of this paper is to develop fast computational techniques for extracting local invariant features through the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU). In particular, we consider an algorithm that uses multiresolutional orientation maps to calculate local descriptors consisting of the histograms of gradient orientations. By using multiresolutional orientation maps and applying Gaussian filters to them, we can obtain voting values for the histograms for all the pixels in a scale space pyramid. We point out that the use of orientation maps has two advantages in GPU computing. First, it improves the efficiency of parallel computing by reducing the number of memory access conflicts in the overlaps among local regions, and secondly it utilizes a fast implementation of Gaussian filters that permits the use of shared memory for the many convolution operations required for orientation maps.

These two facts cause collisions or corrupted delivery due to bad channel conditions, respectively. In one of our previous works, we introduced a high-efficient collision avoidance delivery multicast mechanism to tackle only the collision problem of multicast packets. In this paper, we include in our scheme a new Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) mechanism to also be able to retransmit corrupted packets due to bad channel conditions.

Whenever, a workflow involves a composition of multiple services offered by different organizations, the behaviour of any given service may affect other services and the overall reliability of the workflow. A transactional workflow is considered reliable, if its execution satisfies the Failure Atomicity Requirements (FAR). For example, failure of a payment service requires undoing the order processing service that has been completed already. Thus, it is necessary to represent behavioural dependencies among the constituent services of the workflow and generate its FAR which is useful for checking the reliability of the workflow.

In this paper we presented a formal model, called hidden-mode Markov decision process, for a broad class of nonstationary sequential decision tasks. The proposed model is based on five properties observed in a special type of nonstationary environments, and is applicable to many traffic control type problems. Basically, the hidden-mode model is defined as a fixed number of partially observable modes, each of which specifies an Markov Decision Process (MDP). While state and action spaces are fixed across modes, the transition and reward functions may differ according to the mode. In addition, the mode evolves according to a Markov chain. HM-MDP is a generalization of MDP. In addition to the basic MDP characteristics, HM-MDP also allows the model parameters to change probabilistically. This feature is important because many real-world tasks are nonstationary in nature and cannot be represented accurately by a fixed model. Nevertheless, the hidden-mode model also adds uncertainty to the model parameters and makes the problem, in general, more difficult than the MDPs.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-44565-X_12", "venue": "Sequence Learning", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1587845729,2471138394", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["123329493", "364332", "53827814", "119607069", "61873733", "18315245", "1963904", "14551518", "209832181", "60565534", "1708582", "18783919", "11466814", "30721466", "121258294", "60716402", "29322444", "57464058", "13618539", "5650509", "203995462", "7962049", "9166388", "2749219"], "inbound_citations": ["60973245", "80628430", "12111081", "2629635", "30089630", "163157151", "5253516", "1676584", "9272618", "128358667", "12482248", "181559417", "26991860", "340246", "53032289", "1106629", "52230249", "195945522", "5640257", "6644706", "214623903", "21838878", "1959742", "37350982", "199472690", "202596988", "150373709"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:858957"}

The fork-join nodes that we consider consist of K \u2265 2 parallel servers each of which is equipped with two First Come First Served queues, namely the service-queue and the join-queue. The former stores the tasks waiting to be served while the latter stores the served tasks waiting to be joined. Under heavy load conditions, the variance of the service times associated with the tasks tends to cause long join-queue lengths. In this work, we propose an algorithm to dynamically control the servers\u2019 speeds (e.g., via frequency scaling), that aims at reducing the power consumption of the servers whose join-queue lengths are longer than the others\u2019. Under Markovian assumptions, we provide a model for the performance evaluation of the system in saturation that allows us to derive the expression for the steady-state distribution, the system\u2019s throughput and balance index. Finally, we derive the analytical expression for the marginal state probabilities of each server and provide upper and lower bounds for the expected power consumption.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.peva.2017.08.008", "venue": "Perform.

The unique features offered by technology make it increasingly possible to test for a wide range of language skills required for a specific purpose. With the increasing need to test for English language proficiency and the importance placed on this facility, technology is being utilised to address issues of practicality, speed and efficiency. However, such advantages should not be embraced without due consideration for the essential qualities of any test; validity and reliability. With the inevitable shift towards computer-based testing, certain areas need special consideration. While computer-based tests can provide constructive diagnostic information to complement the language learning process, they should be used more selectively in other contexts, for example in high-stakes tests, examples of which are International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).

Three central assumptions of the standard view of such levels (for instance, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958) are (i) that levels are populated by entities of varying complexity, (ii) that there is a unique hierarchy of levels, ranging from the very small to the very large, and (iii) that the inhabitants of adjacent levels are related by the parthood relation. Using examples from physics, we argue that it is more natural to view the inhabitants of levels as the behaviors of entities, rather than entities themselves. This suggests an account of reduction between levels, according to which one behavior reduces to another if the two are related by an appropriate limit relation. By considering cases where such inter-level reduction fails, we show that the hierarchy of behaviors differs in several respects from the standard hierarchy of entities. In particular, while on the standard view, lower-level entities are \u2018micro\u2019 parts of higher-level entities, on our view, a system\u2019s macro-level behavior can be seen as a (\u2018non-spatial\u2019) part of its micro-level behavior. We argue that this second hierarchy is not really in conflict with the standard view and that it better suits examples of explanation in science.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11229-009-9572-2", "venue": "Synthese", "journal": "Synthese", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1971403646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117465821", "15629338", "118564680", "189782918", "142360088", "62322875", "147965755", "141075080", "32906656", "44870026", "126154764", "17431", "17055967", "18464320", "40643367"], "inbound_citations": ["38221471", "84180183", "59340801", "10609844", "4792288", "59271466"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27078530"}

In this paper, we derive a novel algorithm that is capable of finding CC transmit strategies and can achieve a significant decrease in sum transmit power compared to a conventional zero-forcing power minimization method.

Through this analysis, we also compare the two considered linear formulations for the RCPSP and confirm the efficiency of lower bounds computed in a destructive way.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1287/ijoc.1030.0043", "venue": "INFORMS Journal on Computing", "journal": "INFORMS Journal on Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2158411029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["58849499", "18722332", "468828", "14578494", "29362949", "27321405", "123510822", "59853523", "122186988", "62707446", "61586156", "21767483", "121077730", "3101704", "18088850", "16833820", "18644257", "57006174", "121014602", "27369601"], "inbound_citations": ["22696138", "44927822", "44227411", "145814912", "14139174", "31075817", "1076570", "202233960", "16999939", "8766154", "12904821", "61860851", "9445496", "18928122", "8879980", "6546366", "8975798", "29112279", "8469950", "204804468", "31214218", "43116983", "14177337", "14516928", "54958799", "15783670", "11502797", "40809435", "6453058", "15508463", "1196767", "15056664", "7544642", "208827443"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2414267"}

DR is a key technology for emerging smart electric grids that aim to increase grid efficiency, while incorporating significant amounts of clean renewable energy sources. In today's grid, DR is a rare event that only occurs when actual peak demands exceed the expected peak. In contrast, smart electric grids incentivize consumers to engage in continuous policy-driven DR to 1) optimize power consumption for time-of-use pricing and 2) deal with power variations from non-dispatchable renewable energy sources. While data centers are well-positioned to exploit DR, applications must cope with significant, frequent, and unpredictable changes in available power by regulating their energy footprint. The problem is challenging since data centers often use distributed storage systems that co-locate computation and storage, and serve as a foundation for a variety of stateful distributed applications. As a result, existing approaches that deactivate servers as power decreases do not translate well to DR, since important application-level state may become completely unavailable. In this paper, we propose a DR-compatible storage system that uses staggered node blinking patterns combined with a balanced data layout and popularity-based replication to optimize I/O throughput, data availability, and energy-efficiency as power varies. Initial simulation results show the promise of our approach, which increases I/O throughput by at least 25% compared to an activation approach when adjusting to real-world wind and price fluctuations.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2018536.2018541", "venue": "GreenNets '11", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2030158026", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["214792545", "2176706", "5866448", "52897576", "6161162", "10862360", "2901056", "152369734", "6566382", "15136495", "53222831", "15182037", "13789749", "2548028", "1436742", "13925042", "7661090", "9500037", "16911726", "793177"], "inbound_citations": ["17501475", "18173907", "1934541", "7262438", "1911384", "12337968", "25389094", "16131326", "204770620", "36908944", "15513736", "6102469", "1997027"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2414961"}

The proposed method identifies the sketch recognition process into two user-centered issues: users' drawing habits and input intensions. To capture the users' habit of sketching, a dynamic user modeling is adopted to build the user models in an incremental decision tree for each specific user. It can be used to recognize the 'possible shapes' dynamically by means of fuzzy matching based on the visiting frequency of each recorded shape of user models. To capture the user's input intensions, a relevance feedback method, which is widely used in multimedia retrieval, is introduced into the sketch recognition for the first time. It can adjust iteratively the weights of the similarity-based matching of the sketchy shape and refine the recognition results incrementally by the users' explicit feedback. Experiments have proved that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380487", "venue": "Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

Characterizing the subsurface is extremely complex due to heterogeneity and anisotropy. Due to this complexity, there are uncertainties in the subsurface parameters, which need to be estimated from multiple diverse as well as fragmented data streams. In this paper, we present a non-intrusive joint inversion framework, for integrating data from geophysical and flow sources to constraint subsurface Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN). In this approach, we first estimate bounds on the statistics for the DFN fracture orientations using microseismic data. These bounds are estimated through a combination of a focal mechanism (physics-based approach) and clustering analysis (statistical approach) of seismic data. Then, the fracture lengths are constrained based on the flow data. The efficacy of this multi-physics based joint inversion is demonstrated through a representative synthetic example.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1606.04464", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/sam.11356", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952214267,2952038360,2964140328,2430249817", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Physics", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129227471", "129231748", "132245630", "108644228", "40558194", "129786786", "140710977", "127853739", "129861755", "51898679", "129729022", "128124684", "128342303", "129166986", "138102708", "137077387", "128760509", "120170341", "131539183", "129431394", "129780627", "17123116", "27752177", "30654053", "123361328", "131654705", "128589721", "109003368", "17877957", "43780863", "63651035", "140163595", "138991621", "131621600", "3216554"], "inbound_citations": ["39954647"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2415922"}

The main reason is the unstable condition of wireless networks. Previous attempts to improve TCP performance have been centered on techniques such as queue management, congestion window adjustment, delayed acknowledgement, and etc., because lower layers are hidden in the layered Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. With cross layer techniques, more precise data can be retrieved from lower layers for network condition estimation. In this paper, we analyze and model the factors that affect the TCP throughput in the lower layers. Consequently, to solve the TCP optimization problem, we formulate TCP performance as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). An extensive set of simulation experiments has been performed on NS-2 in order to illustrate that TCP performance can be enhanced by cooperatively adjusting lower layer factors.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6504033", "venue": "2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)", "journal": "2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2057402794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["495833", "17228397", "7248962", "5996270", "6036896", "18050055", "6765147", "207026680", "1599197", "206754919"], "inbound_citations": ["349318", "23268512", "210877142", "14690033", "24099974", "30625059"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2416049"}
